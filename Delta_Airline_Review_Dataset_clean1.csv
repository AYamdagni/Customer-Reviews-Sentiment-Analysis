1,4,17,February,2023,Economy Class,New York , Tel Aviv      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  First, travel starts 6pm arrival at the airport, flight to leave at 8:20pm. Delayed! So I miss my connection! The gate agent at beginning flight couldnâ€™t even log into the system for 40 minutes because he couldnâ€™t remember his password! Causing me to miss Any Outgoing flights to make My connection. Landed 25 minutes before my connection departs and After I run to the gate with no assistance from delta, no cart to Carry me, no communication with gate agent at connection. Making It 15 minutes before departure. They knew I was going to miss my connection! No one told me they would close the gate 15 minutes early out of all the gate agents and flight attendants. No one told me not to run! My Destination consists of a 10 hour flight that only flies at 11:30pm. So I had to Wait the entire next day. The gate agents at connecting flight laughed at my frustration and the sight of me running to the gate . I go looking for my bag while talking to my service and they keep telling me to find a ticket agent at the airport because all they do is book tickets and they canâ€™t help with anything! Canâ€™t find my bag, agent On the phone proceeds to tell me my luggage is at the destination. I get to the ticket agent says itâ€™s not at the destination but wonâ€™t get it because itâ€™s going on the next flight. They gave me a hotel voucher to the Trashiest hotel in town. I got to the nasty hotel at 2am and had to check out at 10am. They offer me $15 food voucher for 24hrs! Delta wouldnâ€™t approve an extended stay. I had no clothes! Had to buy everything. Had to stay 13hrs at the airport! The whole time the airport agents tell me to call customer service for help and customer service tells me to talk to the ticket agents. Finally I get $500 ecredit as if I want to fly with delta again. My flight was $1200, hotel at destination that I missed was $500 a night non refundable!  I asked for delta lounge while I wait and denied!  Rude agents across the board. Told me that all my losses and inconvenience was only worth the ecredit! Nothing I can use separate from delta! Such a devalued customer to them! Why would I ever Want to trust them with my time and money. I was deemed unworthy of being a satisfied customer based On the opinion of staff who is not going through what I am and has not suffered my Losses."
2,1,16,February,2023,Economy Class,Milwaukee , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta did not issue any weather waivers so customers can change flights without incurring added costs even though the National Weather Service issued a Winter Storm Warning for our area, we are supposed to get 10 inches of snow, National weather reports indicate 30 million people will be impacted by the storm AND American, United and Southwest all have issued weather waivers. We wanted to take an earlier flight to avoid the storm today but they wanted to charge $1200 per ticket! All we can do now is sit here, watch the snowfall, and wait for our flight to be impacted/cancelled. We have a short 3 day trip and now itâ€™s very likely to be ruined. Unbelievable really."
3,1,10,February,2023,Economy Class,New York , Charlotte       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Per our pilot, there would be a slight delay due to a system/mechanical glitch. After waiting four hours we were told, the plane was returning back to the gate. We all assumed to swap out planes. However, when we got to the gate they said the flight was canceled due to weather conditions (no rain, snow or etc) and surrounding flights were still scheduled including Delta to the same location we were en route to. Additional costs were incurred due to this. The Delta's staff offered no vouchers for food, hotels or anything. Boarding the flight the next day, the new on flight staff apologized for the system issues and flight being rescheduled. They also advised us to contact Delta for compensation. Some flyers had already received refunds, vouchers and sky miles. I just received communication on 2/7/23 for my 9/12/22 advising me Delta does not compensate for weather conditions.  Delta will not do right until they are held accountable."
4,1,8,February,2023,Premium Economy,Atlanta , Cape Town       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  We flew from Atlanta to Cape Town and Back after month. Both times flying we had our baby stroller and car seat checked in. Upon receiving our stroller, the wheel was cracked, as well as the seat was completely snapped. This is an incredibly expensive and well built stroller. It was mishandled in a very inappropriate way. We reached out to the airline a day late per their 7 day policy, we understood completely that we did that, the reasoning was simple, we were in a strange country with no signal and had to figure out what to do. Delta took about 3 days to tell us what to do, that gave us 3 days to handle it and acquire signal, with a baby adjusting to a new country. My wife has been a member of delta for over 6 years and swears by them, she only flies delta. Our claim was initiated and we were very polite to communicate. This was Deltas head baggage control managers response. He said that we aren't at all going to issue anything. He left us with a delta $100 travel voucher. He was rude, he never replied to the email that we sent back begging to help us and understand that we were a day late on our claim. We need a stroller, that's what our baby needs, Delta broke it and they aren't taking any responsibility."
5,2,6,February,2023,Economy Class,Dallas , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom, Trip Verified ,"  Checkin staff always seem unfriendly, no matter how much you smile and be friendly to them. They are the face of Delta - not just cabin crew! I arrive at SKY priority - no â€˜hello, no how is your dayâ€™, just notices an old luggage tag and asks me to remove it and put it on the bin. Fair enough I thought, my fault. I either forget or simply the tags are nearly glued on and just wait for use their scissors. I regularly fly top tier with other delta compatible / SKY team airlines. So, I ask if I can use delta lounge. The answer is no. I ask to double check but get told to ask lounge staff instead - Who later said yes. Isnâ€™t this on the computer? No goodbye. â€œSecurity is over thereâ€, no smile - not once. I get that they do the same thing countless times each day, but isnâ€™t it their job to greet people? Do I need to tip for giving my suitcase to get a fake smile? Come on Delta. A smile really makes it appear that you pretend to care. Sadly, the checkin experience downgraded to 3. Cabin staff much better, on most occasions."
6,3,6,February,2023,First Class,San Jose , Philadelphia , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  After a horrible experience on Spirit Air to go on vacation. I got to fly Delta home. Very tired after a great trip the flight crew were kind and professional, the seats recline. It truly is the little things, a soda, a pair of headphones etc.. But itâ€™s the attitude of the employees at Delta that I am on here to thank and commend. Two experiences were night and day Thanks Delta I will be selecting you again for my next trip."
7,9,5,February,2023,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Kona       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Mixed bag. Crew was excellent. Really tried hard to make up for an aircraft that was very old. Window shade, overhead light, remote - broken. Screen tiny. Pre-ordered meal pathetic. Wrapped cookie on the tray for dessert, no bread. I was so happy to have a wide body to Kona which is a rarity these days but the dinosaur they pulled out was in need of euthanasia. I only hope aircraft maintenance was better than the cabin. Truly the crew was embarrassed and constantly apologizing. I really felt bad for them. On the plus side, Wi-Fi occasionally worked but was not free as advertised."
8,6,4,February,2023,Economy Class,Orlando , Lisbon , New York     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Our flight was to leave JFK on October 13th 2022 at 5pm and to arrive in Lisbon at 8am next day. We had hotel booked in Portugal and a business seminar scheduled for October 15th. All of a sudden our flight was delayed, and then delayed a 2nd time in which Delta offered a $500 voucher to me and my husband. By 3 am we were still in NY and then the flight got cancelled. We lost our hotel in Portugal but still had to pay for it, they booked us a flight in economy to Paris and then to Lisbon on the 14th and by the time we made it to Lisbon we had no bags. Our bags only showed up 3 days later. I filed a claimed and Delta thinks the $500 voucher is compensation enough. I am a yearly paying customer and reconsidering dropping them since that doesn't mean anything to them. Delta is only here to get your money and not caring for anything else. Very disappointed and going to file a second claim."
9,1,1,February,2023,Economy Class,Bangkok , Sanâ€‹ Francisco , Incheon & Seattle   ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Seats were packed like egg-case, I am a small person but everyone's shoulder was touching each other. Super uncomfortable. One less then average meal plus a sandwich before landing is not okay for a 9 hr flight. Only sport you can watch is golf, very strange. I don't think I will want to fly with Delta for a long while."
10,2,30,January,2023,Premium Economy,San Jose , Augusta       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Beware checked bag may not arrive with you at the final destination! I flew home from my Vacation only to find out that my checked bag never make it. At no point did Delta inform me that there was a problem or offer a solution to the problem. I have to call Delta 1800 number 4 times, each time around 30 minutes wait, only to be told that the bag never left CA and that they don't know why. If and when the bag arrive at the final Destination, then I have to call the 1800 number to verify that the bag arrived before heading to the airport. Delta apps does not reflect the reality. 2 Days after I return from my trip will I go to the airport and claim my bag.."
11,2,29,January,2023,Economy Class,Boston , Millbury        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," We had absolutely amazing flight experience. However, we left Boston with 6 people out of 12 who had never flown 2 being infants and the experience getting on the plane was horrible. They were so rude to the people who were inexperienced flyers. We were shocked as 2 had infants and one was disabled."
12,1,28,January,2023,Economy Class,Montego Bay , New York      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Despite the rudeness at the JFK airport, the flight to Jamaica was absolutely great! The flight attendants were very nice, and the snacks were delicious! They also had Coca-Cola. The TV on the airline was not the best, but everything else was great! Before we knew it, we had landed in Montego Bay, Jamaica. I highly recommend this airline!"
13,9,25,January,2023,Premium Economy,Orlando , Minneapolis        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I purchased this ticket in September 2022 and chose my seat. I received email confirmation. The day before this flight, I received a notice that the airplane would be changed, but there was no mention of the need to get a new seat assignment. When I checked in via phone, I received confirmation of checking in, but no indication of the need to choose a seat. When I arrived at the airport, I was shocked to discover that I no longer had a seat on the plan. After a long conversation with a very unhelpful and unsympathetic agent, he assigned me to a window seat in the very back of the plane. The plane was dirty, smelly, and only one of the video screens in our row actually worked, which made even more people angry. My daughter and grandson were told they didn't have seats on the plane at all and had to wait until the whole plane was loaded to be placed in random seats, so our party could not sit together. I am exceptionally disappointed in how I was treated. I purchased a seat, but for some reason, my purchase was not honored."
14,1,22,January,2023,Economy Class,Tokyo , Los Angeles , Detroit     ,Solo Leisure,South Korea, Trip Verified ,"  I like Delta a lot especially amongst US legacy carriers. The hard products are fantastic, such as the free inflight wifi I am using to write this review now at 35000 feet. My international leg from Tokyo to Detroit was decent-comfortable comfort plus seat, entertainment and amenities. The crew aboard was an older team, hence just went through the motions without much personal touch. The meals on the international leg left a lot to be desired as it lacked quantity and substance. I was hungry. My second leg was nice too. Crew were very friendly, present and eager to provide customer service. Enjoyed the abundance of free snacks and drink rounds. I loved the Delta beer that is unique to only Delta. Overall, Delta has the ball on its operation and I appreciate all the investments they are making, which makes their service fairly consistent."
15,8,21,January,2023,Economy Class,Bogota , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  As a loyal Delta customer I was a little disappointed with some crew members not being the nicest on this flight otherwise it would have been a usual five star delta rating. Check in at El Dorado was a breeze and people who work for Delta at the airport were quite nice. As usual I try to board the plane last if I fly economy in case there is an empty row and to my surprise half the flight was full so rather than sitting next to someone the lead flight attendant said I could sit anywhere and I sat behind the exit row. Prior to take off one of the crew members was quite rude to a Spanish speaking customer, made a comment about how he needed to learn English and kept on complaining to his co-worker how tired he was and this and that. Definitely not professional, and non the less rude especially considering youâ€™re on a flight from Latin America to the United States. Every seat had a blanket and pillow, prior to take off we were provided with hand sanitizer, a small amenity kit with ear plugs and an eye mask and headphones. After take off drinks and a small snack consisting of a cold pastry with chicken, fruit and a chocolate were given out along with drinks including alcoholic beverages. In the back galley there were snacks for anyone who wasnâ€™t asleep on this red eye. Aside from that crew member everyone else was very professional and nice as usual. Thereâ€™s a good selection of movies and music but nothing had changed from what they had the month before when I flew to Bogota. Overall I would say 8/10."
16,8,20,January,2023,Business Class,Jackson , Jacksonville , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I gave up an assigned seat for a passenger traveling with his family in order that he could fly with his wife and two children. I was offered compensation of $500 and a full ticket to fly at a later date. I did receive the ticket, but only half the money. As of today's date of 20 January, 2023, I've only received $250 of the $500. I've contacted Delta Airlines over 18 times, and was told this morning it will probably be another 7 to 10 days before I hear back if Delta has resolve this problem. I will never fly Delta Airlines again, and if I have no other choice but to, I definitely will never volunteer to give up a seat to fly at a later date! This has been pain in the ass trying to collect the $250 owed to me, and I still haven't received the money!"
17,1,20,January,2023,Economy Class,New Orleans , Frankfurt       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Considering it was the holidays, there were minimal issues. The staff were friendly on both legs of my trip. The airport had passport issues but nothing on the part of Delta. My bags arrived to both destinations on time. I fly Delta 3-4 times a year and always been on time without incident. Friendly, efficient, timely, couldn't ask for more in this insane world of travel."
18,8,20,January,2023,Economy Class,Atlanta , Panama City       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Awful experience. We boarded the plane and backed out of the gate when the pilot came on and told us our flight was cancelled due to fog. (Which is fine better safe than sorry) but the next flight wasn't scheduled until 8:45 am the next day. The Atlanta Airport is an absolute nightmare. There were no hotels available in the area and no rental cars available. Delta offered no assistance whatsoever. No compensation, not even a food voucher. We had to sleep in the airport which was scary to say the least. This was two days ago and we have yet to see any sort of apology or compensation for our terrible experience. They just left us stranded for a whole night. They would not even give us our luggage when we were trying to find a rental car. To get from Las Vegas back to PCB took a day and a half. We could have just driven and gotten there sooner."
19,2,20,January,2023,Economy Class,Buffalo , Myrtle Beach , Detroit     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I planned a trip to visit my daughter for New Year's as I was unable to see her or any of my family for Christmas due to the storm. My first flight was delayed over an hour due to ""mechanical issues"" causing me to miss my connecting flight in Detroit by 10-15 minutes, and passengers were not allowed to de-board the plane and opt to stay in Buffalo rather than continue with the flight. Despite requests from my daughter, who had the same connection in Detroit, Delta would not hold the plane so that I could make the connection. My daughter was able to change the itinerary so that I could still make it before midnight, but it involved me now flying 4 flights rather than 2. Again, the 3rd flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight by 10-15 minutes again, and again Delta was unwilling to hold the plane. Because of this, I was forced to stay in Atlanta overnight by myself instead of spending the holiday with my family. I reached out to Delta's customer service requesting a refund but they would only offer a $100 travel voucher (mind you, my ticket was about $260 initially) as the itinerary was already flown (despite the fact that the only reason I flew the itinerary is because I was not allowed off my plane in Buffalo). I requested numerous times to be escalated to a supervisor but the Delta customer service rep refused, and then responded saying she would no longer respond to my correspondence. I have now been left with no choice but to file complaints with the BBB and DOT. Needless to say, neither myself nor my family will ever be flying with Delta again, and I would advise to anyone I know the same."
20,1,18,January,2023,Economy Class,Tokyo , Toronto , Detroit      ,Business,Canada, Trip Verified ,  I was waiting to collect my checked-in baggage for more than an hour before I was told by Delta that they have mishandled my baggage and so it will not arrive on the same day. The baggage arrived at midnight of the next day. Awful experience.
21,1,17,January,2023,Economy Class,Burlington , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  First time flying Delta domestically and surely my last. The stress they put you through definitely is not worth the price. Wouldnâ€™t go through it even if I was being paid for. Catching an early morning itself is stressful enough but Delta just had to make it tougher. I woke up at 3 AM just to find out that my seat had been changed after check in. The lady who handled our baggage failed to mention that to us, the lady who assisted us before boarding promised it will be changed when boarding, have to say not surprised when she couldnâ€™t keep her promise that was made by her own self only minutes ago. Was told to have the cabin attendant assist us but even she was not willing to either. It was if Delta was playing the blame game amongst their own crew which proves how insufficient their service is and how unprofessional they are. Wouldâ€™ve expected a company so big to have a clear understanding of where responsibility stands in certain cases but now we know that doesnâ€™t apply for them. Donâ€™t let Delta ruin your trip because itâ€™s definitely not worth it. Writing this before take off so letâ€™s all hope we at least get to the destination safe."
22,2,16,January,2023,Economy Class,Toronto , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Canada,Not Verified ,  The worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had on a plane. Delayed an hour from departure due to 1 missing passenger then had to de ice so we were already behind schedule. The pilot let us know after we were all seated that the second in command was going to be flying. Take off was a bit rough but landing was okay. Once we landed we waited from 8:30 to 10:30 in the plane for a gate . 2 FKN hours. Finally got to baggage pickup and our luggage was in the plane for almost 3 hours after letting us off the plane. Spent hours 2-3 in the baggage services room waiting for an update on our luggage. Finally got our luggage and got out at around 1:30 am from a flight that was 1.5 hours and was supposed to arrive at 8
23,1,16,January,2023,Economy Class,Denver , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta is the only airline I have flown in the last two years that hasnâ€™t been absolutely awful. No worries about a carry on and itâ€™s size, no headaches when delays are communicated, ability to charge your electronic devices on flights, free snacks and drinks, and comfortable planes. Our flight the other day was stuck on the tarmac for 3+ hours and the airline credited us for our negative experience unprompted and made it right. Blown away by the customer service. Every other airline is just headache after headache after headache with absolutely no reprieve or compensation and itâ€™s just not worth the money in comparison. Delta is a little pricier than other but absolutely worth it in the end."
24,10,15,January,2023,Economy Class,New York , Orlando       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Kiosk for bag check in having issues and was forced to see a representative. Was told I was 5 minutes too late and could no longer check the bag. I was required to schedule a new flight to a new city. Horrible service. Fly frontier, at least they don't pretend they're something they're not."
25,1,9,January,2023,Economy Class,Boston , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Flight was not bad and staff was friendly however once things go wrong do not expect any help or customer service. I arrived in ATL and they lost my bag only to be told by the ticket agent maybe it was stolen ... seriously. Next I'm told to open a delayed bag case. Nothing done by the airline after this. I had to call constantly and with no updates or help I had to track down the bag myself by calling everywhere, somehow it ended up with American Airlines. The staff at American was friendly and helpful and offered to get the bag to Delta. I could not contact anyone at Delta to accept the bag and calling their ""customer service "" line is useless. Tooke two more days and countless calls to get my bag correctly sent to me then another day to get them to deliver it. Each person I spoke to was nice enough and professional but each one told me they could not help so what are they even calling it customer service for."
26,1,8,January,2023,Economy Class,Dallas , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta cancelled the flight because they did not have an airplane available. Really?! They rebooked us the next day with a layover on the east coast. We booked another airline for about 3 times the price we paid on Delta. Same days tickets are expensive! Called Delta twice to get a refund. Wait time 40 minutes? Asked for a refund. We just learned that the return flight was never cancelled. Wait time to ask yet again for the refund, 59 minutes. This is another bad experience with Delta Airlines"
27,1,6,January,2023,Economy Class,Boston , Portland        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  It was the worst experience I ever had. I am 19 year old, first time travelling alone from College to home (Boston to Portland). Delta cancelled my flight 5 hrs ahead and rebooked me for the next day. Then just about to fly to first leg, they cancelled my 2nd leg flight. At MSP I pleaded to the agents at the Airport and finally got a flight for SEA. I reached 5pm PST in Seattle (after so many cancelations). My next flight to final destination (PDX) was 7.56pm. They kept delaying the flight to 1.45am and finally announced that flight ws canceled. Really. They did not book me to any flight and did not offer any hotel. What do I do at the airport. My parent immediately booked a ticket for the next available flight at 7.30am for a premium price of ~ $520. (A flight which usually cost under $100). Early morning when I reached to the counter to see if I can use my original last leg so I do not have to pay double. I was told they cant do any thing even though my original ticket was to PDX. Desperate to go home first time after 1st semester of my college I boarded the flight on my new ticket and saw empty seats. It is just ridiculous when airlines try to make money and not care about customers. My parents have to shelve out $520 just to fly me from SEA to PDX even though I already had a ticket up to PDX. What a shame! I have spent more then 10 hrs and their customer service is just going in circles and not willing to help. I hope Delta would listen to this feedback. I am not going to fly Delta any more and do not recommend."
28,1,2,January,2023,Economy Class,Atlanta , Pensacola        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified , I am so disappointed. I am writing this for my 77 year old mother who is now sitting in a cold airport until 9am. Her flight has been cancelled and since it is weather related she is left to fend for herself. This is not ok. There should be some sort of accommodation or at least assistance and a discount. How would they feel if it was their mother in this situation
29,1,31,December,2022,Economy Class,Buffalo , Anchorage        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ," Booked with Delta for multiple connecting flights to go from Buffalo to Detroit, Detroit to Seattle, and then from Seattle to Anchorage. First flight out of Buffalo was delayed over an hour with minimal communication, causing me and many others to miss our connecting flights in Detroit. After spending 5 hours in the Detroit airport talking to help desk staff (who were very nice), I was told that they booked me for a flight on New Yearâ€™s Day. All they could give me to make up for their mistake was a $15 food voucher that expired at midnight so I couldnâ€™t use it before the next flight. Awful experience, choosing any other airline, even the more expensive, from now on!"
30,1,31,December,2022,Premium Economy,Ft Lauderdale , West Virginia , Atlanta    ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Re missed DL5143 flight from Atl to CRW. The 4 person Young Family arriving on DL1550 from FFL sprinted from arrival gate to departure gate arriving at 10:42 were denied entry. Flight boarded 10 min early. Changed this morning while we were in flight. Rebooked on flight DL4671 at 9:22 pm. Now a 10hr layover. We asked why it was not recognized that we were on a DL connecting flight and provided a meager 5 - 10 min, which would have been the original scheduled departure. Answer was they would get in trouble if they caused the flight to be Late. Simply very disappointing and surprised that Delta is operating this way. Our arrival destination of CRW is not a hub. Waiting 5 - 10 min on connecting flight departing Early? for a family of 4 would not have affected anyoneâ€™s schedule. I have been given the same reason for a slightly delayed departure by flight attendants. Delta is my favorite airline but my faith has been eroded. And Iâ€™m a little angry. Sitting in Buffalo Wild Wings for next 9 hours."
31,5,28,December,2022,Premium Economy,Florida , Washington DC , Atlanta     ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Flew from Palm Beach to Washington DC for my motherâ€™s funeral. Delta had delayed flights, and then itâ€™s my luggage. The tracking software never updates from â€œout for deliveryâ€ and there is a 4 plus hours on hold when you call Delta. In the mean time, sitting in a hotel with no luggage, no clothes, no toothbrush etc. The last time they lost our luggage it was 3 days in a hotel with no clothes. Hereâ€™s hoping this wonâ€™t be the same - or Iâ€™ll be at my momâ€™s funeral in jeans and sweatshirt."
32,2,27,December,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , San Diego       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," The flight crew from Atlanta to San Diego on Dec 26,2022 was wonderful. One was especially kind and thoughtful. The pilots stood outside the cockpit to say goodbye, and their sincerity was evident. Delta's crews are not always like this, so I wanted to thank them for their service."
33,10,25,December,2022,Economy Class,Seattle , Amsterdam        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta canceled our flight just before Christmas, No explanation or options to chose from at the counter. Booked us to fly on Christmas day, 1h layover to get to our connecting flight and no option to chose a seat. Because of Delta my kids will not spend Christmas with they're grandparents (my youngest never seen them) but on airports and connecting planes. When checking in for the re-booked flights noticed there where no available seats on the flight, tried to get in touch with they're customer service, but after 3h on the phone and multiple attempts online I gave up. It's now 3 am and I can't sleep, wondering If I will still be able to fly and see my family tomorrow. Worst experience with an airline ever, and I use budget ones quite a lot."
34,1,25,December,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Denver        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I never had good experience with this Airline, but my last two experiences are the whole new level. In summer of 2022 I was booking flights back from Europe for my family and they double charged me for same flights and took them 3 weeks to refund the money. In December they canceled our flights to Colorado last-minute two days in a row, and would not rebook us until well half way into our vacation. Insultingly they tried to offer us a layover flight in Los Angeles, on day 4 and even that without a guarantee that would make our direct flight I paid more for, an 8 hour travel. We spent two days including Christmas Eve trying to get a resolution with customer service (if you can call it that). We lost all the money we paid for our stay in Colorado, and ended up staying in Atlanta for the holidays with no plans, and no vacation days left. My emotions aside, this company simply does not feel the need to care for their passengers. Our well being and experience simply takes the backseat, and their frontline people hide behind the process and simply shrug it off. We are simply cargo to them, and cargo can be shuffled around and delayed with no consequences. They surely do not live up to their tone-deaf advertisements they make us watch prior to takeoff. What grinds my gears even more is that they will make you move a pound of language from one bag and right into another because of 'weight limit'. Defies all logic. All bags - by weight and volume still ends up on the same plane. Why would a company have processes in place to add to the passenger frustration, and intentionally not do anything about it. They fully capable to provide everyone care, but they make conscious effort to not do that. They ask us to complete surveys, and I'm sure they get plenty of feedback like this, but they simply chose to not do anything about it. What a shame."
35,1,24,December,2022,Economy Class,New York , San Juan      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  In April 2022, book my flight with Delta to connect to my cruise in Miami. It was my birthday celebration. Delta claim they had a pilot problem. I end up missing my flight but what is worst is, after Delta told us they will provide transportation to the cruise, they left stranded on our own. When we finally got to the Shipping Port, the ship had already left. Now, in December as I write this review I am at JFK again since 4:00am this morning. When I left home my flight was schedule to arrive on time. By the time I got to the airport, the flight is cancel. It is now 11:25am and Delta representatives has given me the push around all morning except for one young who has been trying his best to help us. We call the Delta line about twenty times and when we do got somebody they put us on hold for four hours. My son whoâ€™s birthday we are celebrating is still waiting for someone from Deltaâ€™s headquarters to answer the phone. Mind you we are holding for four hours now and I am not exaggerating. We just cannot delete with the continual push around so we endeavor to stay online no matter how long they have us to wait. Our family friends who is celebrating twenty seven years of marriage has already miss much of their activities for their celebration. We are now trying to get to San Juan because we cannot connect with the ship in Orlando anymore, so we have to connect in San Juan and we are still having the run around. No one has even come to us to offer some sought of comfort. Thereâ€™s one young who has been doing whatever he can but he still needs his supervisors approval and he is having the round around as well. Delta is a disappointment and a public disgrace. No one should ever flight with this airline again. I am so terribly disappointed."
36,1,24,December,2022,Economy Class,Amsterdam , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This is the worst airline by far. My sister flying in from Amsterdam to America for the first time waited at JFK for 24 hrs. Delta staff was rude and unhelpful. Once we were able to rebook her canceled flight she was rebooked to a layover in Atlanta. Her 3 hr layover had an additional 5 hour delay, right before she was supposed to board they pushed the flight another hour(it is now 4am). The airline canceled the flight at 4am after a 5+ hr delay. When trying to get some answered the Delta worker told her â€œnoâ€ when she asked if she could get a question answered. This poor girl has been in airports for over 48 hours with multiple delayed and last minute canceled flights without any assistance, compassion, or kindness from the state. Iâ€™m embarrassed that this is her first experience in America."
37,1,24,December,2022,Premium Economy,Halifax , Cleveland , Toronto /New York    ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This is the worst flying experience I have ever had with any airline. I traveled from Halifax Nova Scotia to Toronto to New York and all the way to Cleveland Hopkins, and my bag was mishandled and landed in Atlanta, Georgia somehow. I have over $800 of gifts, clothes, and belongings in that bag. I have no clothes, toiletries, or gifts for Christmas. I talked to the representative in Cleveland at the Delta baggage claim. They told me the bag would arrive an hour later that night and it would be delivered after. Then the man at the desk calls me 20 min after I left the airport and tells me itâ€™s actually going to arrive the following night at 10 pm. That flight gets canceled and I am told it is going to arrive the next day. That flight also gets canceled. I call delta and try to get a timeframe for delivery and the representative hangs up on me. Then I call again and tell them to reroute the bag to Norfolk, Virginia where Iâ€™m spending Christmas with my family. I texted the rep again using the Delta texting service to ensure it was going there. They said it was going to ORF airport and that there was no update in the system yet. I woke up today Sat Dec 24th to find out my bag is now going from ATL-CLE on DL 1355 even though I specifically instructed Delta two times over the phone and text service to deliver it to Norfolk, Virginia. Now Iâ€™m leaving for my trip to Norfolk, VA and I donâ€™t think my bag is going to get delivered on time. I am without gifts, clothes, and all other belongings and Delta has ruined the holidays for me. Worst flying experience of all time. Never want to fly Delta again. I deserve compensation for this experience."
38,1,23,December,2022,Economy Class,Denver , Hawaii        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  First and foremost, your employees are amazing from the people that helped us at the airport and on the airplane. Iâ€™m assuming the people on the grounds are also working as hard as they can. But you as a company suck. You have over-extended yourself and make promises to customers that you never follow through with and you believe that your vouchers and your credits will make it better. I donâ€™t travel a ton. In fact, maybe once a year, but I am seasoned. I have never flown Delta until this time to Hawaii from Denver. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Delta behaved like it never knew any type of weather existed or knowledge of the workings of an airport. I understand there are always going to be limitations. I have been through delays but nothing like this. My first delay from this trip was due to weather from another city - fine. But it was delayed even further because when we were got to Seattle, there wasnâ€™t a loading bridge that could unload us from the airplane - it was coming from the S gate to the A gate and the pilot didnâ€™t know why. We missed our flight to Hawaii by 10 minutes and couldnâ€™t get one until the next day. If you donâ€™t have the workers/materials or have the workings of the flight even if delayed planned out, donâ€™t make these promises that you can get us there. Do your due diligence and make sure things are running smoothly at the airports you do business at. The next day when we flew out of Seattle to Hawaii - they had to taxi us back due to mechanical issues. After about 45 minutes, I thanked the mechanics after they departed and we were off. Better safe than sorry for this delay. And now that Iâ€™m thinking about it, this was Hawaiian airlines. I do have to say when we did land in Hawaii that day, the luggage people at Delta went way beyond my expectations! It was waiting at their customer service office. Coming home from the LA airport was also a terrible experience. We were of course delayed (no reason given) which was fine but when we were all boarded, we were having issues with the push off tug and we were delayed another hour because we had to wait for another one then when we finally made it to Denver at around 11:30, we had to sit on the plane for two hours with really no true explanation as to why. There were two planes that passed us by & they both went to their unloading gate. I understand weather, I understand shortages of workers but Delta acted as if does not. Donâ€™t offer flights if you canâ€™t follow through to just attempt to get us to the gate in a timely manner. Again the employees were top notch except for your customer service via chat - they couldnâ€™t do nearly as much as when we waited in line for two hours to talk to a human which Iâ€™ll never understand why either - my questions were the same. Bottom line, Delta donâ€™t make promises to your customers you never planned to keep. And give all your employees raises for dealing with your crap!"

Just bum it out here for 3 days. I wont be using this ever again"
40,3,22,December,2022,Economy Class,Spokane , Elmira        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," I read President Ed Bastian's bio about all the things that are important to him. He said about taking care of your customers and being Committed to You (the customer). He says he won't stop until we (the company) makes things right. He talks about his faith, family and community. Well he has not been able to convey any of this to his staff. My daughter just flew Delta to get home for Christmas the last stretch was to be from Detroit to Elmira. The pilot was nice enough to regain time from Salt Lake for another pilot delay. But then in Detroit when they ran to their terminal the gate was closed and the people on the plan were waving to them but the plane sat on the tarmac for another 20 minutes. the employees, or someone could have called that pilot and asked him to wait 5 minutes for customers that have arrived and need to board that small unfilled plane to Elmira with no farther destination from Elmira till the next morning. But no customer courtesy or friendly reliability. Where does love for people, family (customers) and community come into play here? Delta needs to do a much better job in friendly, cooperative and reliable human relations customer service."
41,2,22,December,2022,Economy Class,Spokane , Elmira        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I am writing this review following a experience our daughter and husband had trying visit us for Christmas. Their Delta flight was delayed because Delta could not find a pilot for the flight! When they finally took off, the pilot said he would try to make up the time. Our daughter and husband got there before the connecting flight left, ran to the gate, and even thought the plane was still there, were denied entry! Have a heart Delta, people are trying to get to their families for Christmas. If it weren't for the fact that our closest airport is only serviced by Delta, I would never fly Delta again, nor would I recommend it to anyone! If the delay is your fault Delta, try to make accommodations for people. My daughter and her husband were at the gate before the plane was ready to leave the gate! It's Christmas. It wasn't their fault the plane was late! It was Delta's. And it wasn't weather or a mechanical issue! Really? Did the person at the gate have to be a Grinch?? I could name other issues family members have had with Delta flights recently, but this one definitely had the worst impact! The weather tomorrow is supposed to be bad, so now they might not be able to visit us at all!"
42,3,21,December,2022,Economy Class,"Seattle, WA "," Grand Rapids, MI     ",Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We were originally scheduled to fly out of Seattle > Minneapolis > Grand Rapids MI. Our flight was canceled the day before leaving and rescheduled with an additional layover in Tucson. While in Tucson, there was a â€œmaintenanceâ€ issue which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Minneapolis. When we finally left for Minneapolis, the flight attendants were rude and seemed annoyed with us, as if the passengers control the logistical mess. When we got to Minneapolis, we got a hotel and $15 meal voucher and were rebooked for the 7.45am flight out. It was then delayed to 8.30am then 9, then 10.30 all due to â€œmaintenanceâ€. We spent over $600 for each ticket one way for this abysmal service. Not to mention a blizzard is forecasted for the Midwest and they will most likely cancel the flight. If Delta is going to price gouge its passengers, it better provide planes that work so people can actually leave the airports. Letâ€™s try being proactive rather than reactive Delta! If I could give zero stars I would. Generally I book with Alaska, but I decided to give this a shot. Never again!"
43,1,20,December,2022,Economy Class,Minneapolis , Saint Paul , Sacramento     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I used to love Delta, but my feelings have changed recently. Purchased a flight for them and was charged almost an additional $200 to get the flight times I wanted. Received an email a few weeks before the flight letting me know they had changed my flight times and essentially ate two of my vacation days. The times they changed them to were also the cheapest out of the original option. No reimbursement, no refund, no apology. We sent an email to corporate but never received a response and I spoke to a Delta representative at the airport and they told me to contact corporate again after my flight. Finally a week after the flight they contacted us and let us know they couldn't refund us because the flight had already passed... very shady and unacceptable behavior on Deltas part. I will be using every avenue to escalate and advertise this horrible behavior by Delta."

On the last leg of the trip I did get assistance and while getting on the flight from Boston to Indy I asked the lady that greeted people if there was empty seats could I move so I can stretch out my leg, she was very kind and said oh yes no problem. Once they closed the doors I moved, the second attendant came back signing with hands and face ""what am I doing?"" I explained but she seemed irritated, I asked is that ok? While looking at her phone she nodded yea and waved her hand as if to say leave her alone. Then made an announcement they were about to take off and ""no more switching of seats"", if the doors are closed doors it really matter if someone that's been traveling all day wants to stretch out? And it wasn't necessary for her to vent her frustration of me invading her private time in the back by calling me out on the PA. At the end as I got up I realized I need to use the restroom, she's standing in the way and from being exhausted I said ""is that the restroom"" instead of can I get to the restroom, and she responded with a ""yea!"" And a look on her face as if to say duh what kind of idiot are you? I realize maybe she had a long day also but maybe train your employees no need to call someone out or belittle them even if they're thinking it."
45,7,17,December,2022,Economy Class,Melbourne Orlando , Amsterdam , Atlanta     ,Business,United States,Not Verified ," Disappointing experience with Delta. I've been flying with Delta for almost 12 years now. Their services are getting worse ever since past Covid. For staff at check-in desk lacking knowledge of latest Covid rules and restrictions of destination country, mandating covid vaccination up-to-date in 2022 when nobody asks for it any longer. If I wasn't a dual citizen, I would've been denied boarding. Ridiculously rude behavior once you dare to raise your concerns and try pointing them to Delta's own site describing the rules. Customer service is horrible. I recall the days when Delta Customer Service person was a pleasant experience to talk with, courteous, going out of their way trying to help you. Those days are unfortunately gone. Being a Delta Gold member (not that it means anything anymore), I was expecting at least to be helped out with offering options. One leg of my returning flight was cancelled 2 days prior to my outbound departure. Me and my entire family was denied boarding until we get it sorted out with Delta Customer Service - all this at the airport, with the Delta personnel at the check in desk telling us while pointing to the service phone: You need to call Delta Customer Support first. What do you make out of that? Is this really how the airline should treat their customers after a change to the trip was done by Delta itself? Before booking your next flight with Delta, you might want to consider whether you want to go through the same experience we went through."

As Toronto airport has been experiencing substantial delays, I made sure to arrive early to catch my flight. Despite the long line, I was able to make it to the check in counter before the one-hour cut off. But then the agent spent 10 minutes questioning me re: my visa. When we finally established that I was right regarding the visa requirement (specifically, people with American visas can travel to Colombia visa free), it was past the cut off time and she refused to check me in. Even though her incompetence caused the delay, she didnâ€™t seem concerned at all and I did not even receive a simple apology. For the next hour, I was passed around between 3 agents just to get rebooked on a flight the next day. I understand that holiday time can be busy. But the lack of professionalism and care from Delta employees is just appalling"

Missed our flight after waiting in line for two hours to get our bags checked in. Employees didnâ€™t even seem concerned. The line was so ridiculously long, everyone was irritated and anxious about their flight. No communication between the staff and passengers. A few people including myself, were sent back to the line after making it to the front desk because our flights werenâ€™t â€œpriorityâ€ at the time and by the time we made it back to the front desk, our flight was closed. Delayed our trip almost a full day. Never flying with Delta."

Previous vacations revealed the same situation exists at Miami airport as well. As a frequent cruise traveler, I know that cruise line such as carnival, celebrity, princess, royal Caribbean, and others, routinely disembark and embark thousands of passengers every Friday from both Port Canaveral as well as Port Everglades Florida. The lack of flight opportunities from Delta represents a significant loss of opportunity in order to service their customers and make money. This situation required myself and my companions to be forced to wait several hours in order to obtain a flight back to our home destinations."

Iâ€™m so disappointed, frustrated and believe Delta should attempt to make this right. There were no options given other than a full flight standby that we also couldnâ€™t board. I tried contacting their customer service by text just to be given a link to file a complaint/no resolution, giving the message that they really donâ€™t care too much about their customers. Will be cancelling my delta credit card & flying with other airlines."

Check in was okay using the priority lane through my FF status. The security at SEA took ages but that wasn't Delta's fault, boarding on to a brand new aircraft was organised so quickly at my seat 10F which was comfortable with lots of space. Departure was delayed 90 minutes due to a snow storm but again not Delta's fault and it was handled well with lots of information about the plane de icing process, once in the air crew where friendly and visible serving drinks and snacks. The aircraft was great with good entertainment quiet and clean, if I had any complaint it would be that perhaps a meal could be offered on a flight over 5 hours; considering the delay I was on the flight for almost 7 hours. Would use them again pretty good."

I bought a ticket for my husband, The flight time was 6:15 pm and he was supposed to attend to a very important business dinner and take care of family emergencies the day after, the flight was delayed and they kept changing the gate. ^he latest update was 9:54 pm and it wasnâ€™t even a 100% guarantee! He decided to forget about it since the dinner was already canceled! He had to drive early morning the next day to take care of family emergency, not only it caused us unnecessary expenses such as two full tanks and an oil change because the car wasnâ€™t ready to drive that much mileage but also it was a waste of time driving! Not only Delta is not taking responsibility and ignoring my request to reimburse us on the gas money at least, they do donâ€™t even care enough to give us a call and let us explain over the phone, they only communicate over email and it took them 30+ days to respond and that was after I had to follow up otherwise they donâ€™t care enough to take care of customers. They really donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m going to pay more attention to reviews next time."

Glad for the time because there is one staff person to check in us non-priority people with bags, and a line 20 deep. Staff better, Delta. Raise the pay, hire more, and stop nickle-and-diming a service that should be standard, like checking in. This is an average Wednesday morning, not a holiday."

Then stood at the empty customer service counter flagging Delta agents down x3 when an agent finally showed up. Mind you, I used the black phone prior to be told they couldnâ€™t help me and I needed to go to the customer service counter. Waited at the airport for almost three hours trying to get accommodation and then had five hours at the hotel before getting back to the airport for the plane to leave late and then finally got to Rapid City only for them to lose my luggage and took over 1 hour to get my information to hopefully get my luggage someday.

She literally yelled at me, like a child. No one is as there to direct the flow of customers. The Agent, made me look like the enemy to everyone in line. After passing through TSA I shed a few tears, as I will be missing my family and gone for several months. I will be in the future traveling friendlier skies!"

I havenâ€™t encountered a flight attendant, a customer service representative or honestly anyone that is employed by Delta that has a good attitude, demeanour, or tone when communicating with customers. Itâ€™s honestly wild how they talk to any and every customer. Bold business strategy to charge twice as much as all of the competition and treat the people on your planes like inanimate objects. Folks get treated better and are addressed more properly at a McDonaldâ€™s than on any of the Delta aircraft Iâ€™ve encountered."

Both first class flight attendants in our recent trip from Boston to San Diego were excellent. Stephen provided drinks and responded to questions with quick service and smooth professionalism, and Vitidrana was simply outstanding all around. She was friendly & helpful, with a witty, great sense of humor. She went out of her way to make each passenger feel special, with personalized service and little courtesies I haven't seen before. The food and drink were also top-notch, not something you can frequently say about airline food. My husband & I were impressed and grateful for the entire flight experience and especially for the flight attendants' care. Great job with this crew, Delta!"

I was given a message that my seat would be selected at the gate. The website allowed me to purchased a comfort seat on the second flight. When I saw the Delta representative arrive to the gate I approached the counter said Good morning and asked how she was doing? Delta CSR response - what do you need, I explained that I needed my seat selected and asked if I could have one of the comfort seats. She stated no and continued to look at the monitor about 15 seconds of silence passed before I asked if there was a reason why. She stated in a very negative tone while rolling her eyes you purchased coach so you don't get to upgrade for free. I tried to explain it would not give me the option to upgrade to comfort because only available seats were blocked by the airline, I told Delta's CSR she could see that I did purchase comfort on my connecting flight. I asked could I pay the difference for the comfort seat. She stated you would need to repurchase a whole new ticket and I would not be reimbursed for the existing one. I then asked may I have row 36 seat C, she never responded never looked up just continued as if I never asked a question but took several deep breaths every few seconds. Again another 15-20 seconds of silence then she says I'm printing your new ticket. Delta's CSR decided to select a different seat with no explanation, she handed me the ticket and said next. Delta's CSR was rude, disrespectful, extremely unprofessional and lacks customer service and communication skills. If I could've received a refund I would have preferred to drive the 9 hours than to spend a dime with Delta."

The entire experience was great, start to finish. Flying in and out of MSP is always great, such a well thought out airport with lot of restaurants and amenities (even a chiropractor!!), and Delta ground staff made it easy with a super quick check in. Crew on MSP to SFO was good, although we had lots of rough air and didn't see them much. I really appreciated all the communication regarding this from the flight deck. The crew on way back last night, SFO-MSP, was excellent making several trips up and down the aisle offering beverages. They were also very pleasant and not just doing their job. Very happy I live in Minneapolis and have the opportunity to fly Delta to most of my travel destinations."

Allison was fantastic with my daughter, who wasnâ€™t feeling great with allergies from the drastic climate difference. She was very friendly and helpful with bags and wrangling a 3 year old that has been up since 2:00am to catch the early flight! She made a new â€œbest friendâ€ and was able to juggle all the things as they were coming down the aisle. Flying into Raleigh in bad weather added some turbulence, but she made her a happy camper. Thanks Allison!"
65,10,27,November,2022,Business Class,New York , Bogota ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," As usual Deltaâ€™s onboard staff is what has made me a loyal customer. Letâ€™s begin Thanksgiving weekend at JFK was a bit of a mess as usual lines were long to check in as well as to get through customs. In total it took about two hours which made me arrive at the gate by the time they had started boarding. Once I entered the plane I was greeted by the cabin crew, there was a blanket and pillow in every seat and prior to take-off I was provided with headphones. About 50 minutes into the flight you could choose from a cheese plate or chicken salad sandwich along with beer, wine or non-alcoholic drinks. I was offered an extra meal since I asked for one which was good. Inflight entertainment was excellent. The only bad thing was the tray table was broken on my seat. Hour and a half prior to landing there was another drink service. One thing I didnâ€™t see which I usually do on Delta is a water service halfway through the flight. We landed in Bogota on time and Delta excelled as usual. Also thanks to being a T-Mobile customer I was able to use wifi and internet throughout the whole flight free of charge."
66,8,26,November,2022,Business Class,New York , Frankfurt       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta One check-in at JFK T4 was seamless. However, there was a long queue outside of the Sky Club. Though I had access to the ""priority line"", I skipped the lounge and went straight to the Amex Lounge. The main purpose of a lounge is to provide a nice space to relax before a flight. What is the point to get to a lounge that is ""at capacity""? With all the news I heard recently, this seems to be a chronic issue rather than an unexpected situation. Delta did not do any upgrade on its A330-200, meaning the Delta One seat was very old. It was relatively comfortable, but it was worn out with virtually no storage space. I think the most basic part of a business class flat bed seat is a small, secured storage space so passengers can put away small items like eye glasses, wallets and phones while sleeping. On the good side, staff are courteous and accommodating, and I can see a significant improvement in meal quality. They also provided slippers, which was a nice touch. I got a good deal for this flight, so I think it offered good value."
67,7,26,November,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Amsterdam        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My wife and I flew first class from Atlanta to Amsterdam, then KLM to Dubai. The Delta flights were to and from Atlanta - Amsterdam. KLM flights were from Amsterdam to/from Dubai. The KLM flights were great, everything worked correctly in first class and as usual the crew gives first class passengers a nice house model gift after the flights. The Delta flight was horrific, the plane was very old, did not work correctly was a flight from hell really and every passenger complained about the worst experience ever for a first class flight. Our delta first class seats on both flights did not have power working. Our media system - movies did not work. Does Delta care about this horrible experience? Appalled and disgusted with Delta!"
68,1,25,November,2022,Economy Class,Albany , Omaha        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Unfortunately I had to travel on Thanksgiving day. The crew and flight attendants from each flight were among some of the best I have met in 30 years of world wide travel. We had a medical emergency on our flight and this crew went above and beyond. They could have been sour about spending their Thanksgiving at work yet they were positive and thankful for our service (especially Jasmine). In addition all gate agents went out if their way to ensure alternate arrangements from late flights. Thank you.
69,8,24,November,2022,First Class,Jacksonville , Columbus , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I was satisfied with Delta. I appreciated the fact that everything was on time. Had a bad experience with the Broker (Priceline) but I dont believe that had anything to do with Delta so I wonâ€™t fault them. There are so many of them Delta canâ€™t keep tabs on every little detail given by them. Seats were very comfortable and had more room than my last airline I used. The only two negatives I felt were that one plane had really old rear seat entertainment that was slow and only worked half the time. The other 3 flights were new and worked excellent. Didnâ€™t bother me much because it was a short flight. A longer flight would have been a different story. Also, they only had water and coffee options and for the price it seems like you should at least have soda if not available paid beverages. Very on time airline and seems reliable. Liked that I could pick my seat ahead of time. I will fly again and maybe only through delta."
70,10,21,November,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Saint Martin       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We decided to splurge for 1st class. The entertainment system is down, no tv. We are in seat 1 but were the last to be asked about food so, we were told what we were getting, no options. The flight attendant is much less than friendly. She ignored for us for a while while texting on her phone. Being in seat 1, we learned that we had to put all bags overhead, as there is a wall I front of us & a bar & safety kit beneath our seats. So much for having an underseat bag with everything we need to be able to get to quickly. I went to the bathroom in 1st class. Thereâ€™s no way it was cleaned, the trash can was overflowing."
71,2,21,November,2022,Economy Class,Lihue , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My family, 13 of us, flew round trip from Seattle to Kauai. Five flew Hawaiian Air, six flew Alaskan air, my wife and I flew Delta Air. Between military service, FAA carriers, professional and pleasure travel, we have all logged thousands of air travel miles. All of our tickets were with in $25 in cost of each other, our Delta tickets were the highest. On Alaskan and Hawaiian Air my family members were all fed a meal, the service flowed nicely, the onboard entertainment and Wi-Fi all went well. The seats were comfortable and not too cramped. I can say none of that about our Delta flight experience. The plane was in shabby shape, my wifeâ€™s seat cousin was broken, the screams did not work, we were packed in like sardines. No food offered without charges. Service was grumpy. Never fly with Delta again."
72,2,20,November,2022,First Class,Charlotte , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," Beware of Deltaâ€™s cancellation policies. They are predatory and the customer service are appalling. Even if you cancel over a month before your flight, you will not get a refund and you will be charged a cancelation fee. They will offer you â€œcreditsâ€ instead of a refund, so it is completely possible for you to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars through Delta and not even get to fly anywhere. Steer to United or American as they are much more customer service focused and their cancelation/changes policies are far more lenient."
73,1,19,November,2022,Economy Class,Minneapolis , San Diego       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified , We flew with Delta to New Orleans and the crews were great. We flew home on 11/18/22 on flight 2969 on our connecting flight to San Diego from Minneapolis. The head stewardess was out of Atlanta. She was so wonderful! It made it one of the best flights we ever had. Because of your flight attendants we will try to fly Delta every time.
74,10,16,November,2022,Economy Class,Haneda , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," The staff was very professional and kind. They distributed chocolate at the end of the flight and made sure to say â€œthank you for your business.â€ The side to side seat space was better than I expected. The leg space was adequate, would have been nice to have a little more (but I mean, thereâ€™s always room for more space lol). The airplane was clean and comfortable. The food was â€œairplane foodâ€ but it was fine. Overall, a really comfortable international flying experience."
75,8,14,November,2022,Economy Class,New Orleans , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Went to baggage check to declare legal firearm, properly stowed with carry license. Concierge called cops on me and told all her co-workers without allowing me to declare the firearm. It was legally stowed, which is what the police found out after detaining me and questioning me and my parents for an hour. If you're a person of color trying to follow protocol, I wouldn't fly Delta unless you want to get detained and miss all your flights for absolutely no breach of regulation."
76,1,14,November,2022,Economy Class,Orange County , Seoul , Seattle     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Beware of Delta! Never again for us! We had book a flight and DELTA changed the connection to Seattle with only a 35 minute layover for a flight in another terminal. (We did not choose this). It is physically impossible to make the connection in Seattle. Our plane landed on time and we ran to the gate with 10 minutes to spare - but they already left. Now we are leaving tomorrow and will miss the tour we had up. We were told they always leave 19 minutes early!  The hotel says that Delta pays for 30 rooms every night regardless because of this. Something is seriously wrong with management here. To begin with this route needs to be cancelled. And the inflight screen says free WiFi and messaging but after you go down that rabbit hole itâ€™s only for T-Mobile customers. Typical Delta.
77,1,14,November,2022,Economy Class,Huntsville , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  I flew with Delta Airlines from Huntsville, AL to Chicago, IL with a layover in Atlanta, GA on November 09, 2022 on business. On November 12th, my return flight was scheduled for 22:46 departure and were informed around 21:00 that the flight was delayed for one hour due to a pilot arriving late. Then around 22:00 we were informed that the flight was delayed for about 9 hours and we would depart at 08:00 on November 13th. Employees sent us to desk agents in the airport who providing us with assistance. The desk I went to was the International assistance desk I believe. I happened to get in line first so that was a plus. Agents Kimberly and Dexter were assisting us and they were phenomenal. They helped with all information and kept me calm at a time where I was worried. I was provided with a hotel voucher and chose to lodge at the AC Marriott Gateway. I shuttled to the domestic terminal, got on the sky train and shuttled to the hotel. I didnâ€™t like having to put down an incidental card at the hotel which authorized $20 as this expense was not in my budget but I understood it. Overall I was pleased with the accommodations made for me and really appreciate how helpful every employee was as I was asking directional questions to various workers along the way. Some employees appeared off the clock and still helped me with a smile. I have only flown five times and this is the first time I have ever had a delay. Thank you so much Delta and Chicago Oâ€™Hara Airport."
78,9,12,November,2022,Economy Class,Frankfurt , Detroit        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Germany,Not Verified ,  Flight was canceled 2 hours before the departure. The employees are extremely impolite and extremely rude. I have never had an such bad experience with any other airline.

Didnâ€™t think to check seats again before the flight as I would never book us a normal seat. Iâ€™d pay extra and needed to make sure he was comfortable. When we boarded, I realized they changed our seat without notifying us. I let the stewardess know and showed her my email confirmation when I booked. She just said â€˜sorry take a seatâ€™. There is a first class seat available which he was not offered. Horrible customer service."
80,3,10,November,2022,Economy Class,Seattle , Washington        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," I haven't flown Delta for many years and have been flying Alaska and American Airlines during that time. I booked a flight with my company and they grabbed a non-stop Delta flight to Dulles for me from Seattle. I had no grand expectations. In fact, I totally anticipated a flop. How wrong I was to assume. Both my flight to and back from, were roughly two of the best domestic flights I've ever had. Entertainment was great, snacks and beverages were nice; but the team of customer service flight attendants were over the top great. I am switching back to Delta."
81,10,9,November,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Greensboro        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Iâ€™m from Virginia and this was my first time flying so I was pretty nervous but it needed up not being too bad. When it was time for me to go back home on Delta they had said the cabin was too full and so we were forced to check our bags under the plane. I had a duffel bag and when I boarded I could see out my window how rough they were handling it throwing it under the plane to store and when we went to baggage claim at the end of our trip at 11pm I noticed there were two holes torn on my bag and I went to go to customer service to file a claim and there wasnâ€™t anyone around so I ended up driving two hours back home and open my duffel and saw that not only were there holes torn but there were also things broken in my bag.
82,5,8,November,2022,Premium Economy,Minneapolis , Lihue , Los Angeles     ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Deltas service is horrible. I've always preferred Delta, and opened an Amex card to receive more benefits. However, making any modifications is a joke. They don't care at all about the experience. We had issues with our Hawaii trip, but really this review is about a trip we booked for next year. I realized that I needed one more day to do everything we want to on our vacation. So, my husband and I, sitting together, each on our delta apps went to change our flight. We didn't book on one booking because I used a voucher, and we used miles for KY husband. When you use a voucher it has to be on its own booking...which is annoying. Anyway, sitting together, at the exact same time, side by side, we go and change our flights. I was pleasantly surprised as I received a $50 credit by making the change. However, my husband's change errored out. Apparently he had to pay MORE miles to move the day, for the exact same change I received credit for. The explanation was that prices are subject to change at any time, but since it was the same time it made no sense. So anyway, I can't help but believe they gouge prices when redeeming miles. There is no other reason mine would have resulted in a credit. And his required an additonal 6000 miles. We had issues with our Hawaii trip as well. I like their flights, planes are more comfortable than others but Delta does not care at all about their customer experience, especially when making changes."
83,3,5,November,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Kailua Kona       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," A giant word of caution to everyone out there! Before you are duped big time into buying DELTA Comfort Plus Class - you areÂ out of your minds crazy! How do I know that you ask, because my family did! Here is what you actually get for all of that extra money you spent: You get the most awful selection of alcohol you ever want to consume! Wine in a can that is so bitter that you cannot take more than 3 tiny sips, if you can stomach that much. I really want to know...hey Delta where are the upgraded snacks? Because they were not on any of our 6Â (indeed I said 6 flights!) Also I was freezing and according to the Delta website under ""COMFORT PLUS"" it clearly says complimentary pillow and blanket! When I asked my flight attendant for the little pillow and blanket, she looked at me like I was from another planet and said: ""We don't have any pillows or blankets Ma'am"". Just in case anyone should want to know our flights were on: Wednesday, September 21st, 2022. The first flight was Delta# 2836 going from Billings to Minneapolis, the second was Delta#2089 going from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, the third was Delta #0370 going to Hawaii. The fourth was Delta #DL523 going from Kona Hawaii to Los Angeles, the fifth was Delta #DL1145Â  going from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and the finalÂ flight was Delta #3817Â back to Billings. Our family spent thousands of dollars more just to get the extras of ""COMFORT PLUS""! Was it worth it? Considering we never received what was promised in their own description, I would say a big and huge hell no! YouÂ canÂ all think that I am whining and whatever, but I want what I was promised and what I paid for. There is no more leg room in COMFORT PLUS than in Economy! Basically the only difference is that you get seated a tiny bit quicker. Same drinks and snacks. There are no pillows as advertised. However if you have a longer flight you will get very thin and blue hospital like small throw. In no way can it ever be compared to a ""blanket"". Let's face it this airlines is in business for only one reason and that is to take the customers money. They surely are not going to give it back to people in any way. So very disaapointed."
84,1,5,November,2022,Economy Class,Houston , Pensacola        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Horrible experience - delayed flight multiple times, claiming equipment, weather and then lack of pilots.

85,1,5,November,2022,Business Class,Seattle , Fairbanks        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Our flight got delayed and I saw on my app that there's an earlier flight. My app keeps glitching out so I head over to the customer service. When I arrived she immediately tells me if Im not on a flight to Denver she can't help me and walks off.  If she is busy all I wanted to ask if there was a customer service booth nearby. After walking around and not finding one, the earlier flight wasn't available no more. Never flying Delta again. I'll pay extra to fly with another company .. little things matter"
86,1,3,November,2022,Economy Class,Mexico City , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  I just wanted to compliment out flight attendant Robin. I have done quite a bit of flying over the years. She was about the most friendly and efficient I have encountered over the years. She made this flight fun. Delta flight 599 Tuesday October 18th. I sat in 2B. Hope the airline sees this.

Told us we couldn't both board as we missed bag check by 1 minute. Then the plane left early without us.

Everything was perfect, from start to finish. Check in was smooth, and the agent in Boston even offered to check my bag in for free, it was a special promotion that Delta had. Once on board, we got delayed by about 15-20 minutes due to more fuel needing to be added since a new flight route was established. Due to rain and wind in Boston, the pilots were very informative in the fact that we would hit a lot of turbulence. They kept us updated at all times and we even landed in Miami early. Complimentary snacks, drinks, and earphones. A good selection of movies and tv shows for free. Even the Wi-Fi was free, and worked perfectly. The flight attendants were very friendly as well. I appreciated this experience with Delta and theyâ€™re my preferred choice of an airline now. I would recommend them to anyone."

I've come to expect delays in flights, especially coming out of COVID, however Delta led myself and other passengers to believe connecting flights would be taken care of, right up until they weren't. If it's not a Delta-connected flight you're on your own, and not warned beforehand. Upon arrival, cabin crew advised us to speak to service desk, except they had all left by the time we'd arrived, and we spent the night hungry in LAX until 4:30am when they returned. Delta were quick to dust their hands of any responsibility and put it upon the other provider, when we were led to believe it would be coordinated for us. Our situation could have been easily avoided if passengers knew where they stood and what they needed to do from the beginning, rather than be led to believe all is well until you're with another carrier."

No $500 refund given for the hotel as promised. I was flying from Alaska to Maui, while I was in a layover in Seattle. I was flying into Maui for funeral preparations. The Delta flight was delayed several times that day, then canceled late afternoon. The Delta representative said they ran out of hotel vouchers and to find my own, handed me a non working phone number and said to call the number for my refund. Tried several times the number, tried several times online system with Delta for my refund. More than two months later, I have not had any acknowledgment from Delta on this issue or a refund.

Original time out of Milwaukee was 1:30 but it was changed to 1:00 with no notification but luckily were were there early enough. Then we were booked to fly out of Detroit at 4:30 flight 1285 to find out that flight no longer exist and they automatically put us on an 8:15p.m flight again no notification! The kicker is there was a 4:04 flight that they could have changed us to be more in line with what we originally booked but they want us to sit in the Detroit airport for 4 hours instead! The main issue I have is no notification of these changes and no desire by anyone to try to rectify.

They need to train customer service. This trip started out bad and got worse, I am a medallion member and will think twice before I fly with them. I have never been treated so rudely by people that cause the problem, to think I paid more to try to be loyal, not again! Fly anyone but Delta!"

Their customer service skills were exceptional. Not only did they fulfill my needs, but they excelled to make my day better than it was moments before being assisted by them. They preformed a great example of team work while solving the matter at hand. I usually do not fly Delta because quite frankly its one of the more pricey airlines, however, after my last date of travel, I am now convinced Delta is definitely worth the extra dollars, both comfort and experience is highly valued with Delta and that should never go unnoticed. Both employees radiated an admirable work ethic."
98,10,18,October,2022,Economy Class,Paris , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We arrived in Boston around noon, but unfortunately our luggage did not arrive as well. After a 40 minute wait at the baggage carousel, we asked a Delta rep, who told us to open a claim when we get to our final destination. While that may have been true, the tone of indifference was not well appreciated. Another rep checked, and said it would be in Tampa, but not when we arrived there at 10pm that evening. Instead, the luggage would arrive around 7pm, the next day! We flew out of Tampa, but we live over an hour away in Sarasota. That necessitated a trip back to Tampa the next day to get our bags, which eventually showed up around 10pm. Thought Delta was better than that."

100,1,16,October,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , San Jose      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Delta needs to get their act together. My flight was supposed to leave at 6:14 pm. Then it was delayed to 7:33. Then, it was delayed to 7:50. Then it was finally delayed to 9:54. I went to the Delta help desk, which only had one person helping my entire flight of 200+ people. When I finally got to speak to the representative, they said there wasnâ€™t anything they could do, and they gave me a meal voucher. When I went to pay for my very simple, yet typically expensive meal, the server told me the voucher was only good for $15. Where are you going to get a meal in an airport (or anywhere in LA) for $15? When I went back to the help desk to confront them about giving me a meal voucher that would only cover a portion of my meal, which I was forced to get because of my delayed flight, they took so long that I missed my flight. On top of everything, every employee I dealt with was unempathetic and didnâ€™t really care about my situation. They were almost smug about my being at their mercy. Needless to say, I will never be flying Delta again."
101,1,14,October,2022,Economy Class,Miami , Athens        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Colombia, Trip Verified ,"  Very dissatisfied with Delta Air Lines, I won't be traveling with them ever again. Last August 2022, I needed a ticket change of dates, and so I spoke to an international representative who assured me it could be done for a fee, and that it was feasible. Long waiting on the phone with Delta, until they hang up. I called again, and they said I needed to cancel my flight and ask for a refund because the change of dates wasn't possible. Surprised by their negligence, I proceeded and agreed on the refund. After one month, I called to check on the progress of my refund, they said it was taking longer than expected because of the season, but my case was registered so I should expect the refund in a few weeks. A few weeks passed, and no answer from Delta. I called again, same story, they said I just had to wait longer. After 2 months, I finally received an email from Delta recently saying they couldn't file the refund after all. I'm not sure if they're aware of what that even means."
102,4,14,October,2022,Economy Class,San Francisco , Rome       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , This airline does not care about its passengers. Our flight is from San Francisco to Rome with connecting flight in Los Angeles. This airline does not have enough space for the passengers carry on. The person on the podium failed to call our group number so we ended at the end of the line. When we get to the podium to enter the plane they forced us to check in our carry on and we asked to get our carry on in Los Angeles. Delta refused and told us that we were not getting our carry on until we get to Rome. That is approximately 14 hours from the time we board. In the meantime we were not ready for check in so our medicines and necessities were in the hand carry. We didn't want to hold the line so needless to say I was not able to take medicines on time. This airline is pricier than other airlines and they have really bad customer service.
103,1,13,October,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Sydney       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Australia, Trip Verified ,"  Absolutely disgusting airline. On the way there wasnâ€™t great but it wasnâ€™t bad. However, that quickly changed the airline canceled our tickets and then sold them off without telling us. I spent 6 hrs on the phone before they finally booked us in for a flight for the day after we were meant to leave. Then when we got to the airport the baggage drop person also Delta employee literally yelled at us because apparently we didnâ€™t understand something he never explained. Although overall we were not over weight overall he still made us repack or the other option was to pay another $100 even though we had already paid for the extra bag. The planes are not cleaned properly there was rubbish in the compartment in front of my seat and dry drink dripped on the seat itself. The food was horrible, flight crew didnâ€™t even tell us what it was. They only serve a meal in the first 2 hours of a 14 hr flight and the last 2 so you are going over 10 hrs with nothing but water. Most disgusting experience Iâ€™ve ever had with an airline not to mention the 2 hr delay at the airport because â€œ we are missing a pilotâ€. Delta should be ashamed."

105,1,12,October,2022,Economy Class,Austin , San Jose      , Los Angeles    ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I am on an early morning flight from Austin (starting 6:16 pm CST) to SanJose via LAX. This flight started late by more than an hour with some lapse in paper work, fueling etc. This caused my connection in LAX to be missed. Then instead of putting my on immediate connection from LAX to SJC, they made me run pillar to post begging with their rude service staff and stay standby on 2 flights one after another. I was stranded at LAX for close to 4 hours, before catching flight to SJC. They should have automatically confirmed me on the immediate connection but they let me beg to their rude staff multiple times before putting me on standby on 2 flights and waiting at LAX for 4 hours."
106,1,7,October,2022,Economy Class,Sacramento , St Louis       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified , There were 4 of us on one ticket. One needed a wheelchair. We made our reservation months ago and we were not able to sit together except for one leg of the flight. We should have been assigned seats up front because of the disabled person in our group. We should have been able to get seats together because of booking so far in advance. We even had to wait for a wheelchair and we're almost late for our connecting flight. I will never fly with Delta again!
107,1,7,October,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Norfolk        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The plane was not full, but I was told that I had to check my carryon bag because there wasnâ€™t storage. However, there was plenty of room after getting to my seat and people behind me brought his/her carryon bag with them and stored it. The staff did not look. They did the same thing when I was going to Las Vegas. This is unacceptable. Especially since I am entitled to have one carry on bag. When I brought this to a flight attendant attention, I was ignored."
108,2,7,October,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Tel Aviv       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta Airlines turned my trip with My 3 Kids into a complete nightmare. We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years with different Airlines. On December, 18th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time. Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. Iâ€™m willing to bet that due to extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and allowed the plane to take off. Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY.  When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the employee â€œYou knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didnâ€™t you wait for just 2 minutes? She did not answer, but again itâ€™s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going to miss our flight to Israel as well. I donâ€™t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening that we would have to wait for (if Iâ€™m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do whatever needed to be done. She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes, but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he already had a boarding pass, but because of Deltaâ€™s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3 flights. All they needed to do was transfer his boarding pass to the next flight. However, this process was also taking long. They kept on asking him unnecessary questions and he was only 15."
109,1,7,October,2022,Economy Class,Minot , Houston , Minneapolis      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Delta is screwing us all over. First we book a flight with them from Williston ND to Houston, they cancel that flight three weeks after we book it, tell us we can book another flight from Williston to Canada to Minneapolis to Houston. (Flight wouldâ€™ve taken two days with the layovers) No thank you. So we decide to go through Minot to Minneapolis to Houston. Sounds great until two hours before boarding the delays start on that flight and surprise surprise it goes late enough we miss our connecting flight from Minneapolis to Houston. So if we wouldâ€™ve chosen the cheapest option that included the most inconvenient times of day for a person with the longest layover we couldâ€™ve saved ourselves a couple hundred dollars from the beginning. Low and behold, we end up getting those flights and those layover anyhow but still have to pay the extra $200/ticket round trip. We will not be flying Delta again. Hence why on the way home we will be flying United. Delta needs to take a serious look at how many people they are effecting this way. If they care, that is. Also, to the flight attendants, if you are out of coffee, make more."
110,1,6,October,2022,Economy Class,Punta Cana , Atlanta        , Dallas     ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Don't fly as a family if you want a window seat or working air vents. We booked our flights months before the travel date and paid to pick seats that included a window, and at first they tried to seat us all separate, with my 10yo riding by herself. As I told them this was unacceptable, they put us in the very last row in the airplane. I'm not complaining about that a much as the quality of the row. Literally the only row on the entire airplane without windows or working air vents. When I say the whole plane was sketch, it's an understatement. I mean, zip ties holding parts on, plane wasn't cleaned, had garbage all over the floor, etc. Onto the service. Was ignored 3 times while basically yelling for service. They stopped us from entering airplane for 2 minutes while first class was served. Like 25 people sitting there waiting, while some entitled customer was served his Coke. I can go on, but you get the drift. I will never fly delta again.  I expected better from delta, I was wrong. I will never fly Delta again."
111,1,5,October,2022,Premium Economy,Atlanta , Portland        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified , I would like to start by saying I didn't feel the hospitality on my last flight. I had 2 children age 4 and 7 and felt as if I was being lied to and cussed at. We had 2 booster seats that had pink tags on it that were left at the front of where you board the plane to get put under. As we arrive into Portland Oregon (PDX) we get off the plane and our booster seats are nowhere to be found. We stand there waiting for almost 40 minutes before anyone asked what we needed help with. Then they proceeded to tell me that they must have gone to the baggage claim. After 20 minutes (mind you its well over an hour and a half since we landed) at the baggage claim they had taken them off to the side of the baggage claim and never said anything to us. I will keep other airlines in my mind next travels.
112,2,4,October,2022,Economy Class,Rochester , Guatemala City       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," I was flying to a country with a water supply that is questionable, so I had brought a filtered water bottle. Upon boarding the plane I realized I left it in the terminal. The flight attendant took the time to go out and look for it for me, but was not able to find it. Then he said another flight attendant did see it in the restroom, but when they went to retrieve it, it was missing. He took the time to come tell me all of this, and comped me with airline miles - which in my opinion is above and beyond - since it wasnâ€™t their fault I had forgotten it. But it really made my day!"
113,3,4,October,2022,First Class,Toronto , Nashville , Atlanta      ,Couple Leisure,Canada, Trip Verified ,"  We booked a flight from Toronto to Nashville with a quick layover in Atlanta - big mistake! Our flight to Atlanta arrived on time and we went straight from one gate to the other and when we got there the door was shut in our face and weâ€™re told we had to get on the next flight. After waiting quite a while at the unattended desk at the gate the person finally came back and after asking several times why they didnâ€™t let us on she finally told us that our seats were released 10 mins prior to departure! There was not enough time to make it from one to the other before they released our seats and gave them to someone else! Why would they even put you on a connecting flight that is next to impossible to make?! I do however want to say the gentleman at the customer service desk was helpful and ensured we all got on the next flight but pretty much said donâ€™t do a short connection in Atlantaâ€¦ maybe the airline shouldnâ€™t sell them this way then?! Other than that flights were fine, I would still use Delta again but never for a layover/connecting flight"
114,10,2,October,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Woke up super early to fly. Received a message saying my flight was delayed. When checking in the attendant told me everything was fine with my connection. When I arrived my flight had left. Then I was downgraded to regular class (from first) and told to wait 7 hours. I had a 2 day flight so they have ruined my trip. Hate this airline.
115,3,2,October,2022,First Class,New York , Dublin       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Have been mostly an international flyer, I havenâ€™t flown many of our USA airlines much over the years, except for Southwest which is my favorite due to their reliance, service and cost. So, currently flown two Delta flights these last two days and experienced truly an airline that lacks communication between ground and air, as well maintenance. First flight is late, after landing sent to a gate with a plane parked, so waited 20-25 minutes to arrive at another gate, and there is no representative therefore need to wait another 15+minutes. My second Delta flight, plane cleaning crew works overtime cleaning our plane for 45 minutes and we are taking off late again, and then we board plane and air conditioning is not working, so itâ€™s approximately 90 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius and we continue to wait on why we havenâ€™t left after seated for still over 50 minutes. The funny part is they communicated to us about their own incompetence. The best news is no chance to timely get to my connecting flight and may have to spend the night, more money and valuable time wasted! Do not waste time with Delta."
116,1,1,October,2022,Economy Class,Kansas City , Quito , Atlanta     ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,Â Â I purchased a first class ticket for my wife and I. We were denied entrance to Deltas lounge 8n Atlanta. I mistakenly assumed a first class ticket with Delta would allow you allow you access. All other international airlines I've flown allows access.
117,3,1,October,2022,Economy Class,Boston , San Francisco       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I'm disappointed in the way Delta is treating its customers on a delayed flight. Our 6.10pm flight was delayed until morning - they let us know at about 11pm after being told approximately 4 or 5 times, with the times going back and forth. Not one passenger was able to utilize the hotel ""voucher"" and we couldn't access our meal vouchers until we declined the hotel voucher or found a room among the non existent rooms available. We were offered cots and blankets in the baggage claim area. This simply isn't good enough. I especially feel for the customers on the elderly side and the disabled."
118,3,1,October,2022,Economy Class,Detroit , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," I arrived at the airport, got through TSA to look at the boards and find out my flight had been canceled. I was not notified via email or text or call though I gave Delta all my information and permission to contact me. I had received email confirmation of my flight and texted my boarding pass. I was never notified that my flight was canceled. The lady at the counter was useless. Told me she could rebook me on a flight I said okay and then she said sorry it looks like it was taken there are no other options for you. For a refund you need to call customer service or contact them online. I go online and start chatting with an agent. Agent says there's nothing she can do. At this time I call Delta and wait on hold. I have to get in contact with a third and fourth person to get on a flight that works for me, no compensation or sorry or refund. Get better reps. Get better service. Any person that gets their flight canceled day of should get some sort of voucher or compensation. I can't believe that I had to go through this"
119,1,1,October,2022,Economy Class,New York , Barcelona       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," The staff working in New York super unpleasant. We asked where we could check in our bags and they didn't even listen to us, some said one thing and the others that we queue up somewhere else. They did not agree. And my husband and I always feel separated. But what are you up to? It had never happened to us before with any other airline, we tried to change it through the app and it would not let us.  El personal trabajando en Nueva York sÃºper desagradable. PreguntÃ¡bamos a donde poder facturar nuestras maletas y ni nos escuchaban, unos decian una cosa y los otros que hiciÃ©remos cola en otro sitio. No se ponÃ­an de acuerdo.

120,1,30,September,2022,First Class,Detroit , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Horrible customer service, I have called 4 different people and I have been on the phone 3 hours and every single person had a different story about our seats. Paid for preferred seating and got a confirmation this morning of our seats together and called again after that for a different issue and was told ""someone else has your seats and I don't know what to tell you. I can't confirm you can all be on the plane tomorrow"" beyond frustrated and was told no managers or higher up can be transferred to."
121,1,30,September,2022,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham , New York La Guardia , Columbus      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," I pay extra to fly first class to have more room and to be offered drinks and snacks once I am on board. On this flight in first class, the flight attendant offered no drinks or snacks before the flight took off. Once the flight was in the air she left first class and went back to the economy section for over an hour. She did not return once during that time. She returned around 1:25 PM and finally started to take our drink orders. Then stopped and told us she did not have time to get our drink orders and went around with the snack basket. Then she walked back to the economy section with a pot of coffee before taking her seat a few minutes later. I was shocked that this is how the first class was treated on this flight. I thought about saying something to her once she did come back to first class, but decided I did not want to cause any kind of trouble. I know that she knows what her job is in first-class she just chose not to do it and help the flight attendant in the economy. No apology from her and she seemed perfectly fine that she left first class for over an hour and never once came back to check on us. My question to you is why did a pay for a first-class experience and receive by far the worst experience I have ever had on a flight? I have shared my experience with others and they also are shocked. I would like an apology and a partial refund for this flight since I did not receive a first-class trip."
122,1,30,September,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Seoul        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Delta has changed in a negative way. For the past 5 years delta has been my choice airline. Iâ€™m in the military and and frequently traveling and delta was always a safe choice for a positive experience. This was until September of 2022 when I took military leave from South Korea to America with my fiancÃ© from South Korea. We ordered the tickets 4+ months before the flight but despite this we were seated very far from each other. My fiancÃ© was very nervous and scared because it was her first time flying and going to America and was forced to sit alone. I tried to get this resolved but they were unable to help me. Then when trying to return from America to Korea they waited last second to find an issue with the plane that resulted us to have to all get off the jet and be delayed hours. The plane was in the boarding area for 2 hours before and they didnâ€™t find the issue until the very last moment. I donâ€™t know what is up with Delta but this is now 2 times in a row they have screwed me over and I feel embarrassed this is my fiancÃ©s first experience with an American owned airline.
123,2,30,September,2022,First Class,Louisville , Kansas City , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," I was going to try to forget about my experience with this airline, but reading these reviews has inspired me to write this review just to get it off my chest. Practically everyone associated with my trip on Delta (with the exception of the pilot, who I only saw once as I de-boarded the plane) was not only rude but personally insulting. Waiting at the gate for the last leg of my trip, a flight from Atlanta to Kansas City, two female employees at the gate counter acted like they were in a high school girl's bathroom - cackling and laughing like witches over the intercom mike while blurting out info about boarding the flight. I'd never heard such juvenile and unprofessional behavior before, and the whole time I asked myself why would a company hire these characters. Pickings must be extremely slim. The flight attendants at the front of the plane waiting as I boarded the plane were no better. The male-female duo were rating the looks of passengers as they came on board: ""That's a two"" said the female. ""No, that's a one and a half"" said the male attendant. Naturally, as usual, they were two extremely gorgeous specimens who had plenty to say about other people in the looks department, like most of these extremely rude types of characters do. If I didn't have to get to my destination on time with more important things to attend to than rude flight attendants I would have stopped and reprimanded them, but I wisely kept moving to my seat. I've dealt with some real bad apples on a number of these airlines, just trying to get from point A to point B, and I realize that the service industry in general is going down, but this experience on Delta Airlines was the worst yet and is putting me off of flying altogether. It's not bad enough how paying passengers are treated during the pre-flight checks, but then you have to go through the insulting, rude and unprofessional conduct of the Delta counter people and flight attendants. Makes me want to set aside a week, get a car and drive to my destinations rather than go through the clown show that Delta and other airlines are running."
124,1,29,September,2022,First Class,Milwaukee , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Milwaukee to Boston. WARNING: If you check in and are asked if you want to upgrade to first class for only $100, do not agree! It is a rip-off. All Delta did was move us from row 6 to row 3. There appeared to be nothing first class about the seat. Maybe it was an inch or two wider and a couple of inches of leg room. I didn't have an opportunity to compare but the actual seat was about the same as an economy seat in JetBlue. The only extra service was a couple of minutes early seating and orange juice before taking off. After that there was no flight attendant assigned to first class and no meal. There was only the same basket of snacks that was provided to everyone. I never heard of first class without a meal, so I didn't buy anything in the airport. About an hour after one small bag of potato chips I asked for another, but they had none left. For the two of us it was $200 down the drain."
125,1,28,September,2022,Business Class,Chicago , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,  Delta no longer lets you into the lounge unless it is three hours until your departure time. I arrived in Salt Lake City Costco and I had to stand outside for 20 minutes before I could come in. I am in Chicago being told I have to wait 30 minutes before I can come in. Whoever makes rules like these and forces their employees to implement them as a complete idiot. I am traveling first class I am in the Premier category travel frequently and need to contact business and work. I will never fly Delta again after decades unless they change this policy
126,2,28,September,2022,Economy Class,London , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I don't travel frequently and I was traveling alone. I was taking the trip of a lifetime for me to go to the Laver Cup in London. I haven't travelled Internationally and was encouraged by concerned friends to travel business class because I've had spine surgeries. Paying an extremely exorbitant price for a business class round-trip ticket to London was disappointing. For such a price, (several thousand dollars) one should get a decent experience, or at least an experience that justifies the price. Business class ride from Minneapolis to London was mediocre at best, short on food, and what was served was tasteless and lukewarm, monitors not working requiring multiple re-sets, movies reported to be available were not, and home from London to Atlanta was absolutely no class. The seats were very uncomfortable. The only way to elevate feet higher than a miserable 2-3 inches was to lay completely flat. The monitor was stuck on another language and had to be re-set multiple times before finally workable. They ran out of food - note to self- choose the first seats left the front of business class to ensure you get food options and not whatever's left!."
127,1,27,September,2022,Economy Class,Boston , Kansas City       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The first flight was great. The flight home disgusting and the crew doesn't care. I had liquid dripping on me out of the luggage rack, and the crew will tell you it's fine its just the ac. Went with delta because they claim to be the cleanest with the most leg room and free wifi if you have t-mobile (which we do). The seats had not been cleaned, the window had finger prints and forehead smudges to the point I used the sanitizing cloth they give you (that I can only imagine is to clean your seat and area for them as they are too lazy to do it). There was dust around the ac vent so what was dripping on me wasn't from the ac. They didn't make any announcements to tell you that we were in turbulence and needed to stay seated. There was a gentleman standing rocking his baby while we have seatbelt signs on and they never said a word to him. They just turn the light on saying to keep seated with your seatbelts on. But they will announce that everything is safe and the seat belts are no longer needed to keep you safe. The WIFI did not work on either flight.  The flight attendants were rude. Delta needs to do maintenance and upkeep on their planes as well as attempt to clean them at least once a week."
128,1,27,September,2022,Economy Class,Chicago , Tri Cities , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked a ticket with Delta in March 2022 to fly from Chicago from/to Bristol (Tri-Cities), Tennessee, via Atlanta, in June for a conference. Delta cancelled my initial flight a few hours before it was due to depart, rebooking me for the next day (via LGA) and not getting me in until the next evening missing the entire critical first day of the conference. I was told at the airport that bad weather prevented the crew of making it to Chicago on time for the flight. I had to book a ticket on the spot on American Airlines, which could get me to Tennessee the same night. I applied for a refund of the cost of my Delta ticket, which finally was paid over a month later. I also applied for compensation for the fare difference caused by Delta's cancellation (just under $400). Today, over three months later, my request was refused. I was given a ""sorry"" flight credit coupon for $50. It will go unused, as I will never fly Delta again. I hope that this review is published, even though the trip was cancelled, because it is relevant to anyone counting on this airline to get them somewhere."
129,1,27,September,2022,Economy Class,New York , Cleveland       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked a flight from LGA to Cleveland so that I could attend a wedding. I was a groomsman for the wedding and was looking forward to participating in all of the events. I found some flights that worked for my schedule and they happened to be Delta whom I do not typically choose as travel partners. I had coordinated plans with people based on my itinerary but unfortunately found out, that when flying with Delta, a set schedule is always subject to change and your efforts to be a dependable person in regard to your commitment is jeopardized with their great ineptitude of being a reliable transportation service. It might be easiest to understand my disappointment and frustration by simply looking at the attachments of the update texts. From all of my other travel experiences, which I am fortunate and grateful to say is plenty and well above average, I usually receive 1-2 update texts mostly with confirmations of flight and gate information. Delta operates differently than their competitors however as they like to send 10-12 texts with new gate information and change of departure times. For those who like spontaneous adventures, simply book a flight with Delta and you'll be running around the airport all day with changes of departure times every 30-45 minutes! Unfortunately due to all of this irresponsible and unreliable service from Delta, I held many people up and changed a lot of people's schedules simply bc I didn't know when I was going to get in. Eventually plans were canceled and I, with the help of Delta Airlines, ruined a night of fun which was planned a long time in advance. I will say that Delta is consistent in that the return flight was just as bad. I was supposed to take off at 12:15pm and it's currently 5:15pm and our flight has now been pushed back until 7:10pm. Believe me, I'm not holding my breath! In summary though, Delta has proven to me that it is a completely unreliable travel service with little to no regard nor respect for it's customer's time nor plans. If you are someone that would like to pay the same amount of money as their competitors but have no security in when your flight will actually take off, Delta airlines is your best bet. If you purchase flights with a purpose and make plans around the set schedule the airline commits to, then you should be sure to filter out Delta in your search."
130,1,26,September,2022,Premium Economy,Las Vegas , Detroit       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Myself, my wife, our son and his girlfriend went Las Vegas 9-19 returning 9/23. Flight out no problem. nice flight, luggage secure. Return flight however a different story. Both my luggage lock and my son's were missing upon our return to DTW. These were TSA approved locks so if TSA felt the need to search all they had to do was unlock the locks, inspect and return the locks. But no. There was no ""Notice of Inspection"" in the luggage which leads me to believes Delta employees breached our bags. Nothing was missing from either bag? The thought of employees indiscriminately rummaging through our belongings is upsetting to say the least. Also, I had some OTC cold medications (Dayquil / Nyquil liquid) wrapped in a plastic grocery bay with the lids securely tightened. When I opened my bag the Dayquil had leaked all out of the bottle. A little escaped the grocery bag but could have been a huge mess. I fly Delta every time I fly as I am a Sky miles member. This episode is causing me to rethink my loyalty to this airline. Don't bother contacting customer service either."
131,1,23,September,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Entered the plane an hour late had seat 14d. The stewardess told me there wasnâ€™t a place to put bag except in back of plane. Was rude and insisted to move faster. I went back and then had to bump slide and grind my way back to the seat. When I arrived she asked about my back pack which I just learn my seat didnâ€™t have stow away. Finally another guest went out of her way to help. Very shocked at the whole process and rudeness of the staff. Never have I ever experienced a flight attendant talk or handle a simple act like this.
132,4,20,September,2022,Economy Class,West Chester County , Seattle , Detroit    ,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Unacceptable. I missed my connection in Detroit because it took too long to offboard folks from our first flight to Westchester to Detroit. Then with a poker face the Delta representative tells me that â€œsadlyâ€ the next flight Iâ€™m booked on now is in 8 hours! Doesnâ€™t offer any type of compensation. In Europe, when you are delayed by over 3 hours you get compensated, I donâ€™t understand why not in this case."
133,1,20,September,2022,Economy Class,San Antonio , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Wait times for checking baggage at San Antonio were minimal, and Delta staff there were helpful and personable. The flight to Atlanta was on a clean, modern jet with ample space (Comfort+) and conscientious, friendly, professional service. Even had in-flight entertainment for a flight that took less than two hours. No serious complaints for an airline with which I have rarely had negative experiences over the years - from the perspective of being an actual customer of the airline. However, I have a few suggestions for some of their hubs: they could stand to work with the Atlanta airport authority to modernize ATL and enforce standards of cleanliness, to update the airport from 1999 to the modern era and to make it a truly world-class airport rather than the busiest. Delta has the onus since Atlanta is their headquarters and primary global hub, and nearly 75% of all passengers arriving into and departing from Atlanta are using Delta. Delta should also work with the Seattle airport authority for the same thing. A significant share of passengers in Seattle also use Delta, as they are the airline's hub for the Northwest."

Old plane, entertainment system failed and had to be rebooted, my entertainment system did not work (could be I did not work it properly). I chose comfort plus when booking flight but on the return trip I was in the main cabin. It would not let me select comfort plus seat that was x'ed out but not occupied. When I called they just said your are in a mixed cabin (whatever that means). The receipt did not show the breakdown of cost, all I know is I booked for comfort plus. Going to LAX I was in comfort plus and returned in economy and there wasn't much difference."

I have called to speak to someone to get some information about changes that were made by the airline. I first called and was told that the wait was 14 minutes and they could call me back without me loosing my place in line, so I did that. 25 minutes later I called back because no one called me. I have now been on hold for what was originally said to be 14 minutes then changed to 21 and then the recording said I was being transferred to an agent and I have now been listening to the agents in the back ground talking to each other, I presume, for the last 45 minutes and no one has answered my call yet. I can hear them talking and someone moving around close by. I have screamed hello into the phone multiple times to no avail. I have never been so aggravated in my life. Is there even such a thing as customer service any longer. I also left my thoughts on the phone call just in case it really was being recorded like it says, but I am sure no one will ever hear it. This along with many other reasons is why I like to fly SWA. At least they do have customer service."

My plane at LAS was delayed for 1 hour for a minor technical difficulty. Asked the flight attendant and the arrival gate attendant to let the connecting gate know I would be late, but would be there before departure. They both said the departure gate wouldnâ€™t listen so no point. I made it to the connecting gate 10 min before departure and watched them close the door. They wouldnâ€™t let me on the plane. Weâ€™re all just cattle to delta these days. May as well just go with the best, cheapest flight when I travel from now on. If Iâ€™m just a commodity, so is Delta. FYI, the ticket photo I uploaded was for the flight they rebooked me on before I even landed in ATL even though the told the Delta app not to change my flight."
138,1,15,September,2022,First Class,Ft Myers , Dayton , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I flew on a first class ""Sky Priority"" ticket, and as such went to the Sky Lounge in Atlanta. Mind you, I recall an email where they said they'd updated their rules, so I stopped at the door and read the rules on the sign. I saw nothing that seemed to apply to me, so along with other passengers I trekked up the 4 flights to the desk, where I was promptly rejected and told to leave. It turns out that they now require you to have an American Express card, and I was offered the chance to apply, or get out. So I left- I don't want or need more credit cards in my life. Don't get me wrong either, the staff were friendly and professional, and obviously caught in the crappy position of rejecting formerly qualified customers. I don't care that they changed the rules, business is business. I do mind that I was publicly embarrassed when it could have simply been posted at the door. I sat in the concourse nearby to see if it was happening to others and counted 12 other passengers who entered, and came back out looking embarrassed and/or angry. Is it Delta's policy to subject their employees to angry, surprised, embarrassed passengers? And is it their policy to make us resent flying with them? Because that's what's happening with this arbitrary oversight. Put updated signs on the doors, save us all some headaches. Oh, and get rid of the ""sky priority"" language, maybe it should say ""sky priority, but only with a Mastercard"" or something stupid like that. Thanks,"

The outbound flight in Comfort Plus offered pillows, blankets and food for purchase. In contrast, on our overnight return flight from Lihue to Seattle, they ran out of food and had no pillows or blankets for 1st class. We seriously feel that the additional cost we paid for 1st class was a total waste and disappointment. The flight attendant apologized and did make an effort to scrounge up some snacks. The cost of 1st class is exorbitant for senior citizens and failed to meet our expectations in this case."

My husband and I flew on Delta on September 2nd, 2022 from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta. We had a connecting flight to Panama. We originally had an issue with our seating, hubby did get on the phone. He dialed the 1800 #, he was on hold for a while, b-4 someone decided to answer. He explained to the CSR Rep that we were not sitting together on this up coming flight going to Atlanta. Hubby did explain when he booked it originally we sitting together now we were not. The CSR took the time to explain what happened on the original booking and where the changes were made. She did apologize to my husband and she did her best to accommodate us and manage to upgrade us at the same time to comfortable seating. This was nice at the time while trying to resolve our issue. I can't complain about the staff, as they were friendly and polite. What I did not like was that they need to enforce when we are existing the plane, it should be row per row. I did not like the fact people just got up from there seats and were very rude practically pushing there way thru to leave the plane. That's the only part I did not like. If you work for the Airline Delta Carrier please be aware of what is happening on the plane. I strongly suggest On your speaker do say ""Row per Row please""!! And do tell everyone on the plane b-4 existing its row per row starting with the front of the plane FIRST!!! There is NO Etiquette when it comes to existing the plane. Some people are just plane RUDE. Aside from that I had no crazy issues with Delta as this is my first time using this air carrier. I normally fly South West or Jet Blue. I believe this will help avoid fights on the plane."

Flight was to leave at 455, but ended up leaving at 830. I stood in line trying to reschedule my connecting Flight from Atlanta to Panama city beach the entire time we waited for the plane to be fixed. Never got to me before the started boarding again. It took forever to board because the employee with the attitude problem wanted to pull a girl off the Flight to talk to her because she moved seats, which the head Flight attendant gave her permission to do. Finally land in Atlanta and I asked the desk what I needed to do to reschedule my flight. He sent me to d27 where customer service was. I get there and I'm told they are closing. I told them I needed to reschedule a flight I missed because of the airline. The 2 ladies told me again they were closed. So I go to baggage claim to retrieve my carry on. It never comes. So I go to speak to a sweet lady to find my bag. She told me my bag would be put on my new Flight. I get text messages with hotel voucher, food voucher and a new flight. Who needs a hotel if i have to wear the same clothes with no hygiene products? The new flight wasn't going to work for me, I needed an earlier flight, but I can't talk to a person so I can get what I need. This airline needs serious customer service training."

I learned a huge lesson ask for a wheelchair when purchasing your tickets Believe me you wouldnâ€™t want to go through what I did.

My only complaint with delta they wanted to sell seats for $129 each leg even during check in. The flight staff from SFO to ATL were very professional the best I have seen in 20 years but they were training 2 new crew member. Check in was fast (tsa security was slow) at SFO they have clear pass and tsa pass this puts a bottle neck for other passangers. Seats on all legs were large and comfortable even at back of plane. Entertainment system was good, with free earphones. The planes were kept a bit too cold, on international they give you a blanket. Transfers at Atlanta and Boston were quick no going through security again. Food on international was slightly above other airlines.

(No crowds storming the plane) Crew in total control of the plane, well organized, efficient and kind. Flight took off after 2 min delay, arrived with 20 min to spare.

The lady at the front desk took over an hour to process our visa and passport and we missed our flight because of her. Imagine paying over $3,000 for plane tickets, waking up at 3am for your flight and missing it because of an incompetent employee. On top of that, we received no compensation whatsoever. The most we received was an ""I'm sorry"" from one of the employees. She did not now we didn't need an eta permission anymore and kept insisting we file for one. After 30min of her calling multiple places to determine we did not need one, as we previously told her, she took another 30min scanning a visa. She did not know how to do it. I don't blame her. Delta did not train her correctly and when we complained to the supervisor he did not know how to deal with it either besides call customer service."

Delta has literally been the worst airline I've ever traveled with and I travel a lot being in the military. From the start my flight from San Diego got delayed due the aircraft maintenance issues which caused me to miss my connecting flight and have to stay in Atlanta an extra day. They couldn't get me a new flight until 6pm the next day which caused me to miss my best friends wedding and wasted $200 on suit rental for no reason but they gave me a hotel room and meal vouchers for me and my 3 children. When flying back to San Diego I tried to use the meal vouches that I didn't get a chance to use yet and they ""expired"" even though the expiration date is still good. When going to guest services they asked my wife and I why we didn't use them right away and she's not going to issue them back.

My home away from home for decades, equipped with children and a career I need to return to with some semblance of a planâ€¦ however, that plan is being obliterated by Kiwi.com/ Delta Airlines as I speak! Iâ€™m sitting here, 10 kilometers from Incheon airport, where I shall sit until the first flight to Bali that has a seat available, is willing to transport me. This is all Deltaâ€™s doing at the moment, and I cannot believe my own story as I sit back and revel in it while typing. Kiwi.com, however, as a travel agent, is rather complicit in my defenseless position. Iâ€™d be happy to tell you my itinerary was put together by Kiwi.com, with a seemingly flawless algorithm, until I realized that this itinerary relies on every facet of transfers, Covid testing, and airline employees executing their job duties in a timely, effective manner. When this chain is disrupted by one weak link working for Delta Airlines, I became occupational hazard in the flesh, missing flights, having to pay unreal sums of money because we have flight stewards who arenâ€™t attuned to my needs. I started July 26th, 2022 with a flight from Austin, Texas, USA scheduled to 8pmâ€¦ From there to go on to Houston, TX with an 11 hour layover before boarding my Seoul, S. Korea flight, and ultimately from S. Korea to Bali, Indonesia.  My first July 26th flight from Austin to Houston was canceled and rescheduled for the following morning - requiring my 2nd flight from Houston to Atlanta (where I would make my connection to Seoul and onwards home to Bali) to be delayed. This was flight DL1315. I had downloaded the Kiwi.com App as recommended to receive updates and none of this information was posted there. Kiwi.comsâ€™ app was actually such a joke, that my google profile became the de facto OS for me, alerting me to flight delays and suggesting nearby hotels. First off, I am a foreign national in Indonesia, and my passport and visa paperwork clearly show this. However, the woman at the Delta boarding gate in Houston insisted her computer was not up to date on the half a dozen different visas Indonesia gives its ex-pats, and that I could only enter as a tourist. â€œFineâ€ I say, â€œenter me as a tourist.â€ But a tourist must show an outbound international flight to enter Indonesia. Naturally, as a permanent resident of Indonesia, I had booked a 1-way ticket home to Bali. Despite all my pleas and .gov info from Indonesia Customs online, Delta would not allow me to board the seat I paid for until I ordered an outbound tic"
156,2,30,August,2022,Economy Class,Las Vegas , London Heathrow , Salt Lake City  ,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Verified ,"  Being someone who is hard of hearing and having to wear hearing aids it is really difficult on a flight when they only provide small in ear headphones for the entertainment system. I usually remember to take my own over the ear ones and am able to leave my hearing aids in which enables me to hear cabin crew and still maintain conversations with people as well as make use of the entertainment. Yesterday on a flight with Delta I had forgotten my own and asked the cabin crew member if they had any over the ear headphones, he just looked irritated and said no just these and handed me the little in-ear ones and walked off. I didn't fancy staring into space for 10 hours so I removed my hearing aids and tried my best with the in-ear phones, I turned the volume up full and just about managed to hear the system. The only problem with this was that I could then not hear what cabin crew were saying or any of the safety announcements. It was not a nice experience to have cabin crew rolling their eyes to other people when I couldn't hear what they said the first time, it was extremely embarrassing and uncomfortable. This was not a nice flight and I don't think I would fly with Delta again because of it. I will say that apart from that experience the rest of the flight was okay."

The flight departed at 9:20 pm and it was the last flight to San Diego that evening. I misread the boarding time as the departure time and got to the gate late. The door was closed and the jet bridge was moving away from the plane. I spoke to the gate agent and explained I misread my ticket. One of the male flight attendants on the plane saw me at the gate. The gate agent, flight attendant, and the pilot all spoke and decided to open up the doors for me to board. They obviously did not have to do that and it is unheard of. It was at the end of their shift and they could have handled the situation a million different ways, but instead decided to bless me and extend grace to me for my mistake. I was beyond grateful to them for going above and beyond for me. Thank you Delta crew on flight 2759 for your incredible customer service!"

As expected, no one there at that hour. Wheel broken off suitcase and deep gouge in fabric. Obviously mishandled. Okay - this happens. The next day I was about 200 miles away in Denali and tried to file a claim by phone. Tried to make a claim by website. Totally impossible. I was on various forms of chat for almost an hour. Kept getting rerouted to various departments most of whom turned out to be robot computers - they sound good at first, till you finally figure out they are not real people and they tell you essentially your question is beyond them. At one point I got a person who was nice but she went off shift before anything resolved. Going in circles. Finally gave it up as an impossible quest. At one point was told all I could do was file a complaint as I did not report it at the airport - at 2am. My time is worth more than this or the suitcase, which was not even new and for which I would have settled for maybe $75. Left a very bad taste. Especially since I was on vacation. I am 87 years old and was at the start of a solo 16 day journey through Alaska by car - having a suitcase that won't roll and that I can't pick up is very stressful - I just left it in the boot of the car. Delta should have better customer service. The flight itself was fine."
159,10,26,August,2022,Economy Class,Chicago , Tokyo , Atlanta      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I have never experienced such absolutely appalling, rude, and condescending customer service in my life as I did at the counter in Midway. Short, snippy, and sarcastic, the agent seemed to want to have very little to do with us from the minute we stepped to the counter. No smile, no hello, no greeting. And it was all downhill from there. We had been planning for my son to participate in a foreign exchange program for a year and a half. Made all the arrangements, did all the research, and checked all the boxes. We chose Delta because they had an arrival time inside of a time window we needed to meet. Simple enough. He is a minor. He is old enough to opt out of the Delta Unaccompanied Minor program, where they charge an extra $150 and require someone at the destination to jump through a bunch of hoops to pick him up. The host organization already had a process in place. We researched the unaccompanied minor rules and regulations. The host organization would have someone waiting to meet with him at the gate in Japan. No problem. We chose to opt out of the unaccompanied minor program because the Delta website rules specifically state: https://www.delta.com/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program ""If I decline the Unaccompanied Minor Service for my 15-17 year old, can I still accompany them to the gate? Yes. If you are dropping off or picking up your minor but opted out of the Unaccompanied Minor program, we will issue you a pass to accompany your child to the gate. Please check with an airport agent at the time of check-in to have the gate pass issued."" We arrive at the ticket counter to begin the process and the agent is visibly annoyed that she now has to go through all of this process first thing in the morning (visa, passport, covid test verification, etc) and she makes it very clear through her body language and attitude that she is annoyed. Then we get to the part where I request a pass to accompany my son to his gate. She responds ""No. He's old enough to travel by himself."" I mention the rules we had researched, and after some tense back and forth, she says ""no, we're not Southwest."" Now, tensions are escalating and my son is upset. She even walks away at one point to go do something else that seemed completely unrelated to us. I know if I escalate any further, I run the risk of expulsion from the airport, so we take our boarding pass and move away. My son is very upset at this point and asks if there is anything else we can do. We get back in line to try a different agent. This one is even worse. I opened the discussion with a recap of our previous encounter and even showed her the Delta website I had pulled up on my phone. She looks right at it and says the only thing she can do is enroll him in the unaccompanied minor program. So I say, ""ok, let's do that."" She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump. She leans forward, places her hands face down on the counter looks up with her head cocked to the side and says ""fine. But I'm going to need a lot of information."" She has us fill out a form which is quite comprehensive, then starts pausing at every other word to ask if the spelling is correct. The process drags on so long, and the tension was so uncomfortable, that my son asks if we can just go. I express to them that the amount of trouble to go through this when the rules clearly state that it should amount to a simple request is ridiculous. So my son started his trip alone. Lesson learned."

When we arrived in the Airport, we went to the Delta desk speaking with a supervisor who gave us a lot of problems. First she asked for extra money without checking our online ticket, where everything was already paid. Than when she discovered her mistake, she started to be rude and asking for extra money again without explain us that we could avoid it. Fortunately later we changed desk, where we found a gentleman who explained us that the problem was the weight and we could balance all our bags.

Even with a 2 hour equipment delay, it was a great trip. Thanks Delta for great service in these hard times. Please commend Gena and Tatiata in SLC."

One flight attendant worked his tail off to provide good service for 24 people with nothing to work with. Mediocre food offerings but excellent service. WiFi advertised and sold but not working. This is a horrible aircraft for this route. Economy passengers passing through to use first class bathroom so no peace. Should be much better but by todayâ€™s lowered standards, acceptable. Delta Club in Honolulu was excellent."

All the times my flight has waited for a passenger when they are late. I was 15 minutes before the flight, saw the plane at the gate but was informed I could not get on because the flight was leaving ""early"". I have nothing bad to say about the gentleman that helped me at the gate, he did his best. Maybe all airlines have just gone to hell."

I felt we owed the airline this review especially with all of the bad publicity they get quite often, I scheduled a trip for my aging mother and I was nervous to let her fly alone, she's not helpless but she gets nervous and can get lost especially in an area she's never been, I signed her up for assistance at the airport and assistance changing planes also, her trip was wonderful, she was worried about flying also and getting to where she needed to be to catch next flight and finding her bags and everything, the airline and staff took great care of her the whole flight and even in the change over in Atlanta, she said everyone was helpful and no one made her feel as if she was a burden having to be in a wheelchair, she had a 4 hour layover in Atlanta and staff even checked on her and helped her get something to eat and drink during the wait, we just want to say thank you to everyone that helped make it possible for my mother to make this trip, she hadn't seen her sisters in person for 8 year's due to her husband passing away and no one else could be off work to take her, they had a wonderful 2 weeks together and my mom had a great experience flying there and back, she was treated with kindness and respect the whole time, her body doesn't work as good as it used to but her mind is sharp and that's why she was so nervous to fly, she didn't want to be a hardship for anyone, our family can't thank the staff of the airline enough for all of there kindness, they went above and beyond there job to assist an elderly passenger"

My boyfriend is a quadriplegic from an accident on a farm in Minnesota. Getting on from Cincinnati was fine but getting off the plane at Minneapolis was a nightmare. 3 grown men couldnâ€™t figure out how to lift a 160lb person. They have no proper training of how to move a patient properly. They let his top half tip over. Then they couldnâ€™t get his motorized $50k chair off even though he told them how to do it they were just annoyed and didnâ€™t listen to anything he said. They wanted to put him in a chair without a chest strap and basically send him on his way. If this is their job and they offer these services they need to be trained properly and not have an awful attitude when theyâ€™re not the ones paralyzed. Then at the end they were so adamant about our boarding passes to get paid. You almost hurt him and almost broke his wheelchair you donâ€™t deserve anything from your terrible mean â€œassistanceâ€.

Me, wife, 3 kids and a dog. entertainment system did not work on the way to Brazil and on the way back after 2 months span.  Bought a comfort seat on the Delta app and when I got on plane it was not what I had purchased, spoke with a rude and unprofessional flight attendant, he asked me to remain seated until the flight departure, after been on the air and ask him for a solution he respond to me to just go on line and make a complain and said that he was not going to do anything, even said that he was going to write a complain about me after I asked his name stating that since I was going to report to delta airline that he was going to just do the same. Purchased internet in flight for kids since entertainment system did not work and found out internet was just good to send emails and do very minimum work. not video streaming at all. Even Delta app wont allow you to watch anything on plane since entertainment system did not work. After getting home I contacted delta about my miles and got informed that the ticket I purchased (over $1000 per flight) was told that I do not get miles for the ticket I had purchased. Have not flew with Delta for a while and after this 3 international trip experience I believe I will stay way from them again."
171,1,11,August,2022,Economy Class,Cleveland , Sao Paulo , New York    ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Worst experience ever! It started with going from Boston to Atlanta with no problems. Then when we boarded they held us back for over an hour for issues with the engine. Then when we were headed home from Punta Cana to Atlanta we got there and they didnâ€™t have a gate for us ready so it room an extra 45 minutes. Which then we had to run to make our next flight. Then we get on the plane to go to Boston and they held us for another 45 minutes cause it was raining and they needed rain gear. Then we get to Boston and we are in a group of 4 and only one of our luggages comes out and they lost the other three. Worst airline. All they do is lose your bags and do nothing about it.
172,3,10,August,2022,Economy Class,Boston , Punta Cana       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The worse airline I've ever used. I've arrived to Minneapolis and didn't find my two luggages. They were left in Paris. I've filed a claim, they don't answer the calls and when they answer their rude customer support representative will hung up the phone and tell you he is helping another customer.  They will tell you you will get a compensations ""estimated $50 per day for the items you purchase due to the delay"" but they won't! Very unprofessional staff. Very irresponsible this is my 3rd day here and I don't have my luggage yet!"

Zero explanation even though we had confirmation numbers. Finally reached Delta after flight left and told by a very callous employee that we would have to wait until 13 Aug to leave. We found multiple other options with other carriers, but Delta didnâ€™t want to pay for those. On our own dime, we took a 15 hour train to Amsterdam to fly out on 4 Aug. Upon arrival in Boston, we spent nearly 3 hours on tarmac due to mechanical issue before returning to gate. No hotel voucher provided to spend night in Boston. And to top it off, I was only one in the group to receive my checked baggage. Awful customer service and complete disregard for their customers."
174,1,9,August,2022,Economy Class,New York JFK , Sao Paulo ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Brazil,Not Verified ,  Horrible customer service. I travel over 6 times a year as I work in the US and my family lives in Brazil and Delta gave me the worst experience I have ever had in my life of travels. The flight was delayed for 4 hours then canceled and rescheduled for 22 hours later with no hotels or amenities offered (only a 30 dollar voucher). The rescheduled flight was delayed once again and communication was scarce. Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Pathetic customer service/care for the lack of a better word.
175,1,8,August,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , San Francisco      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Canada,Not Verified ,"  Unfortunately we experienced very poor customer service on this flight. The boarding staff were flustered and short tempered with all passengers due to some confusion and then forced about 20 of us to sky check our luggage without explanation, which was extremely inconvenient as we were then taking a connecting flight with another airline and this added significant delay to our travel time. Upon boarding there were several open overhead baggage bins many of which remained completely empty for the flight making our forced baggage check completely unnecessary. Needless to say, I would avoid taking this airline again if not necessary."

The first Miami - New York with little time before the departure time received an email with the change for 3 hours later causing inconvenience but arriving in New York the same day selected. The second very serious mishap was when we arrived at the airport and found out that the flight to Miami on Sunday 7/31 was cancelled. They did not give an explanation or solution for the problem they caused. After several hours and before the claim of rights that we passengers have. I was placed in a 3 star hotel without any other benefits. It is well known that they must provide passengers with lodging, food, transportation and make the necessary arrangements for them to arrive at the destination by air as they purchased the original ticket. They must close this airline that does not comply with the published schedules or routes. It has terrible service and the employees are poorly trained."
178,1,7,August,2022,Economy Class,Seoul Incheon , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta is generally fine for people looking to save money and are eager for adventure. The staff are hit or miss for kindness but nothing above and beyond (like what you might find in higher quality airlines like Singapore Air, Korean Air, ANA, etc). There were a lot of mix ups (we didnâ€™t get the baby bassinet we reserved, we didnâ€™t get the 100% fruit meal we reserved, etc.) and many times it felt like the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. The most challenging issue was that the connection flight was several hours late and no genuine support was given for a place to rest which can be especially hard for families with babies and young children. If your priority is health, especially for medical conditions or families with small children, higher quality airlines might be a better fit. The food was fine, not the freshest but not poor quality. They kept advertising about how free the wifi was but when you go in, itâ€™s only free for T-Mobile subscribers (felt like either a bad joke or deliberate deception). In-flight entertainment however was about an 8/10 (lots of great English movies music etc for all ages, but almost nothing available for other languages [only subtitles])."

And return flight with my wife included. We check in online well in advance and we get assigned seats all over. With a 9-year old daughter. Despite the fact the seats around me have not been assigned. This industry and business wants to charge you $79.00 to purchase the seat just next to you that hasnâ€™t been assigned. Really? 5 tickets. Four tickets purchased together with minors and Delta canâ€™t put me on the same row on a red eye flight with unassigned seats.  Happened on way from New Orleans to Salt Lake. When they cancel a flight and you then have an overbooked flight with everyone scrambling fighting over seats because the seating has changed with no notice. So one guy is saying this is my seat with his ticket on his phone and another individual with a printed ticket with the same seat. Instead of making an announcement, the staff leaves the passengers to argue and figure it out then tell everyone they have to move to their assigned seats. Delta and other airlines make traveling miserable. Poorly run. Any industry that loads from the front to the back is backwards anyway. And I have heard the reasoning for loading front to back. Only a fool actually legitimizes such explanations. Seriously. $79 to change a seat. To an unassigned seat just next to me. On a red eye flight. Minors traveling with me and they canâ€™t put us together? I wonâ€™t pay your extra and I will try to avoid using your services."

I can safely safe I will be flying with Delta in the future and hope I get to have the come along a flight with me, thank you lovely ladies for such a nice time!

I purchased 3 tickets for my children and they were treated like they purchased a basic economy ticket. On the first leg my son wanted a bottle of water and was asked what he was doing in the â€œDelta Oneâ€ cabin, by an awful flight attendant, the same cabin I couldnâ€™t even purchase or upgrade them to after transferring 1.5 million points from my Centurion American Express account. It doesnâ€™t matter how much youâ€™re willing to spend unless youâ€™re a loyal flying customer with Delta Airlines and hold a Delta American Express credit card. I know now what happened, I didnâ€™t have a Delta Skymiles American Express credit card. But I do have a Centurion American Express credit card, it means nothing to them and the flight attendants treated my children like animals going from only one country to the other. I have over 80 million miles to transfer to any airline and Delta Airlines is an absolute joke. Iâ€™d rather spend $200,000 for my kids to get to their destination on a Global 6000 aircraft by flying them on a private jet. The Delta Airline flight attendants should be punished for their actions, Iâ€™ll never allow my family nor myself to fly on this airline ever again."

First flight was 3 hours delayed and got stuck in Minneapolis because they couldnâ€™t wait 2 minutes for our flight to Omaha.

At 5 pm the plane landed in Charlotte as it was diverted mid-flight claiming for passenger safety. Not sure how they didn't know they cant land in LGA before taking off. In Charlotte, they delayed planned take off for 3 hours, each time pushing it back by 1 hr increments as we sat on the plane. Finally at around 9 pm they announced the flight is cancelled as they don't have a co-pilot. It took another hour to collect our bags from baggage claim. In return they sent an apology and a voucher for a hotel in Denver. Finally this morning they sent another $50 voucher as if that makes up for anything and ruined our plans. I lost my hotel booking in NYC that was paid for. I had to pay for my hotel in Charlotte. I lost my Broadway show tickets. I also had to pay another $800 for a return flight from Charlotte to Denver because my travel plans were for one day only. During this entire time I was unable to get in touch with any customer support staff from Delta despite waiting on the phone for > 2 hrs. It was impossible to have any customer care representative contacted and they claimed it was due to high call volumes I was also trying to reach someone through text messaging starting at 9 pm. They got back to me at 3 am the next day waking me up from sleep. I have flown with Delta for many years and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. You should be ashamed of treating your customers like this."

I have beer in my luggage I wanted to bring back, on the delta app, they recommended paying extra at customer service for them to take special care of your bag. I get to the airport and there's not one single person at customer service for delta. There was also another gentleman looking for delta customer service, he had no boarding pass set on his phone. It took about an hour to have security call delta from the other side of customs, and was told to just bring the large luggage to security. There, I was getting integrated before security.  Then I head into security they unpacked, unwrapped, scanned and wiped nearly every item, taking another hour nearly. Also, no help getting my stuff back together in my luggage. Finally, they take my luggage to the plane, I quickly gather my belongings (shoes/phone/purse) and start walking down towards the plane tube and the pilot is walking back, towards me with my bag telling me I took to long and cannot fly. Security wouldn't even look at me after this, knowing it was partially their fault for taking their sweet as time, on top of not helping me put my stuff back together the way it was. The amount of times i was told ""sorry you took too long"" made me even more hysterical. I took too long? This all happened because you had zero staff upfront to check my bag! My flight was changed to the next day, no hotel accommodation ""because I took too long"". I ask them what they are going to do to make this right, I just got ""we're very sorry for the inconvenience, call a friend or family back home and ask for some money"". It's currently 2am back home. All my people are sleeping! I selected an isle seat when purchasing my ticket, and now have no say on where I sit for this next flight. If you want to be inappropriately interrogated, and told over and over that everything is your fault, and miss your flight due to lack of delta staff, you won't be disappointed. I'm a paying customer and this is how I am being treated?"

When I arrived in Seattle my connecting Delta flight (4053) had already finished boarding yet they held the doors open just a little longer because there was one passenger who had yet to arrive. I was that passenger. As I ran toward the gate I heard a voice call out, ""Are you AliceAnn? "" He seemed genuinely glad and relieved that I was going to be able to make the flight. I know they could have easily closed the doors and carried on, but they didn't. I can't tell you how thankful I am for the care and consideration the Delta employees gave me today."

We had 3 people on a flight and she said only 2 of us could go and to leave our friend! She screamed, no, Iâ€™m closing the door super loud at us. And failed to reschedule our flight on top of her letting a another passenger in front of us that was after us on that list. On top of rolling her eyes at all of us. Nobody would help us.

By Sunday 2 of the bags made it to Augusta Regional while the other 2 were in Atlanta, about 2.5 hrs away. We were told the bags were going to be flown to Augusta since they have at least 4 flights a day to and from Atlanta. It is now Friday of the following week and our bags are headed to Paris. This is just the poorest customer support on the planet. If you plan to fly and come back empty handed fly Delta. You will not be disappointed."

Such a poor customer service. They said it was due to weather, so they won't provide a hotel, while there was a plane take off at the same time that my flight was supposed to. I had to book a hotel while I have only 230$ in my bank account. I came to Boston for an interview because I'm a student, hugely broke. I was very tired after my 5-hrs long interview. So I wanted to stay at a hotel. I was asking friends to send me some extra dollars so that I can stay at a hotel. What a irresponsible airline indeed. And I don't trust the airplanes got canceled because of the weather baloney. There was a thunder storm warning, yes true. But one flight decided to flight at the same time and other flight is not? I understand if you want to cancel the flight, but at least send an email notification. I will never fly with Delta again."

I'll also be letting anyone around me that is about to travel by air that the worst mistake for them to make would be to fly with Delta. They made everyone stand in line for at the bare minimum of 25 minutes while waiting for one flight attendant, causing the time for take off to be pushed way back. Our family knew time was of the essence so we asked if there was anyway the plane for our 2nd connection (that Delta switched up instead of a straight flight) could wait since we might be late along with others in our plane on the next connection. After we landed in Salt Lake City and got off the plane we ran as fast as possible to the gate that was supposed to be waiting for us and these people but nope, plane was closed for boarding and then a whole 7 hours sitting in the airport thanks to this excuse of an airline service."

We flew from Venice to Atlanta (10 hours). Arrived and went through customs, dropped our bags with the Delta rep to be checked and put on our connecting flight for Spokane, Wa., checked the reader board and saw our flight had been canceled. After asking around the terminal we located the Delta desk area. The rep confirmed the flight had been canceled because they couldnâ€™t get enough manning to work it. We were booked on the next days flight which is packed of course and Iâ€™m now seated separate from my wife? And there is no guarantee that flight will even make it and it now has a change in Seattle instead of going straight through. These people care nothing about the customer. We are now stuck in a city across the country from our home with no luggage and no clothing to change into after sweating in the 92 degree heat outside the airport. They deserve bankruptcy."

I then proceeded to argue with him whether 11:05pm after 10:45pm since you know, I can't board the second flight until another one lands. I finally got them, to their credit, to provide a room for the night and meal voucher. We land at our destination and I ask where the carry on bags are located because mine wasn't at the flight deck like they said it would be. I hadn't spoken a word when the Delta desk attendant said, ""do you have a question?"" To which I responded ""yes,"" and he curtly replied ""then what is it I can help you with?"""

My son is 17 y old and he was flying alone from NYC to Vancouver. His flight got delayed, hours later cancelled. He was given an alternative flight which placed in situation to be completely alone at the airport overnight. I talked to 2 different representatives on the phone and they both dropped my phone call after saying: Don't worry. We will figure the best and fastest route for your son. Give us a few mins to review this. Conveniently, both of my phone calls were dropped after 45 mins being on hold. Delta did not support, help or accommodate him with anything. His flight following morning was again delayed by almost 3 hours. I understand The act of God situations and try to be as patient and understandable of situation. Delta air line dropped the ball on 17 year old child. I am disappointed and angry. There is a lots of parents working in airline industry and I am sure they all agree that we need to be extra vigilant about teenagers flying alone, especially those that are asking for help!"

Yet First on this old and noisy 757 was so cramped that I had to literally fold my 6'2"" into this seat (it's 37 inch pitch) which seemed literally insulting for First Class on a 5 hour flight. To continue the theme, on the LATAM code share connection from BOG to MDE (2 hours delayed) I ended up in actual coach, and not just that, in a random middle seat because neither Delta nor LATAM were able to reserve seats, and this even though the flight carried a DL code. Food on Delta was pretty good and the flight attendants caring. Still, overall not an experience I want to repeat."

I cancelled three tickets that I paid $3300. These were cancelled within 5 days of booking the flight. Delta would not refund the money but offered to give me e credit for the tickets. Even though I paid for all three tickets, they will only allow me the credit for the one in my name. Delta always begs the government to bail them out during bad economic times, but doesnâ€™t seem to care about its customers when they need help. And yet they have the nerve to overbook flights and inconvenience their customers on a daily basis. To say I am disappointed with Delta is an understatement. Let the buyer beware. Donâ€™t fly Delta."
201,7,17,July,2022,Economy Class,New York JFK , Los Angeles , Seattle   ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I woke up at 2.30 am to get to JFK for a 7.05 flight. We had first class seats. I turned on my cell phone and found an email advising that Delta cancelled my flight and automatically rescheduled my flight, not as a non-stop to Seattle which was supposed to arrive at 10.15 am, but as a flight to LAX, leaving at approx. 2.50 pm, changing planes after a layover, leaving LAX at approx. 7.30 pm and arriving in Seattle at approx. 9.50 pm. We were seated apart on both flights. There was a 2-hour delay in LA and we arrived at 11.45 pm. I got to bed at 1.45 am Seattle time, having been awake for approx. 26 hours. I incurred expense for the cancelled morning limo from home to JFK. I lost an entire day in Seattle with only two days planned. I have dietary restrictions that I brought to Deltaâ€™s attention in advance of the trip. That information did not carryover to either flight and I could not eat anything but nuts! Delta has no business over-scheduling flights if they donâ€™t have crews or planes to fulfil their commitment to passengers. Spending all that money for first class to endure this on the first day of a long-awaited vacation is not just disappointing, it is unacceptable. We should be given a full refund for both flights. Delta's commitment to its passengers is a farce and I publish this story as a warning to those foolish enough to fly Delta."
202,1,17,July,2022,Economy Class,New York , Phoenix       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  At baggage drop off, they had a person checking that all the bags are tagged and turned around anyone who didn't have it placed. A group of 6 people with more than 20 bags were prioritized over 20 existing people waiting in line with no tags what so ever, Spent 45 minutes tagging their bags (which should have been Self-tagged) With only 2 agents! This is unacceptable, they should tag their own bags and wait in line like every body else!"
203,4,16,July,2022,Economy Class,New York , New Orleans      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Australia,Not Verified ,"  Total price gauging and ridiculous spin. Over the last 2 months we have flown 16 flights on 13 different carriers. That is, 1) Qantas Port Macquarie to Brisbane 2) Emirates Brisbane to Dubai 3) Emirates Dubai to Paris 4) Flyr Pisa to Oslo 5) British Airways Oslo to London Heathrow 6) Aer Lingus London Heathrow to Belfast Northern Ireland 7) Ryanair, Dublin Ireland to Malaga Spain 8) Air Brussels, Malaga Spain to Brussels, Belgium 9) Air Malta, Brussels Belgium to Malta 10) ITA, Malta to Rome 11) Tarom Romanian, Rome to Bucharest 12) Austrian Airlines, Belgrade to Vienna 13) Austrian Airlines, Vienna to Dubrovnik Croatia 14) Croatia Airlines, Split to London, England 15) British Airways, Heathrow London to Newark NYC 16) Delta Airways, La Guardia New York NYC to New Orleans. By flight 16, our bags are very close to 23 kgs. A few pounds over which every single other carrier has let through due to immaterial difference. But not Delta. Tried to charge us 100 US per bag for excess baggage. Mine was over by 500 grams. Seriously. And then we were fed the most ridiculous justification for it - (not blaming the check in guy - he is just repeating nonsensical spoon fed information). But including small aircraft (our Qantas flight was a turbo prop Q400), needing to manage weight (redistributing into cabin bags still goes on the plane!) and needing to remain competitive advantage (really? By price gauging?). Anyway. No more Delta for us ever again. Pick all the other airlines Iâ€™ve listed."
204,2,15,July,2022,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth , Salt Lake City    ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,  Our flight was delayed out of DFW due to thunderstorms. We missed our connecting flight as a result in SLC. The three of us were tired and drained after a 3 day work conference and thank God the people at Delta were so amazing. We got complimentary drinks on the flight. On arrival we got expedient service at the counter to re book our flight free of charge. They even re routed our bags so we could have them. Which only took a couple minutes to retrieve! (Thanks baggage service!) Because of an overnight stay we were given a voucher for a nearby Doubletree (each of us our own room!) And a meal voucher for the hotel. Customer service was beyond exceptional even though they were clearly overwhelmed. In these difficult travel times even the flight staff were just beyond patient and collected. Thanks Delta!
205,1,15,July,2022,Economy Class,Lisbon , New York       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This is the worst flight experience our family had in years. The checking and security check processes in LIS took almost three hours. We arrived at the airport 3 hours in advance and thought we had a plenty of time to have a breakfast and cup of coffee. There were only about 10 families in ahead of us at the airport, it took about almost 10 minutes for each family to check in and get the boarding passes. Furthermore, when we finally boarded, the seats weren't cleaned, the trash bags were missing. The pockets in front of us were filled with garbage. The worst thing's worst, we found a rubber band inside of my three-year-old son's chicken spring roll."
206,1,13,July,2022,Economy Class,Oklahoma City , Charlottesville       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,  Absolutely terrible service. Flights delayed for 2 days straight with minimum compensation. Getting to my destination 2 days behind and then being notified that my bag hasnâ€™t arrived and will have to be delivered to me the next day. Come to find out that I am being told two different stories as to where the bag is. Itâ€™s either just arriving at 4:38 PM or is already out for delivery. I drive all the way to the airport just to fix this issue and am told that it is 25 minutes away from my home. Just absolutely terrible time with Delta.
207,10,12,July,2022,Economy Class,New York La Guardia , Denver        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  LaGuardia to Denver. For the first time in a long time I had an amazing experience with an airline! Iâ€™ve had issues with Delta in the past but this experience was way better than I could have imagined. I volunteered to be bumped to the next flight for $$$ which was awesome. But thankfully that flight had the best flight attendant Iâ€™ve ever had! She was amazing! So welcoming and sweet and really went out of her way to make everyone happy.
208,1,12,July,2022,Economy Class,Amsterdam , Mississippi , Atlanta      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Thank you, Delta, for locating and returning our lost bag, all in good order.

Immediately opened a file for delayed baggage and was told that they would handle things and deliver my lost/delayed bag asap. Today is July 11th and I have not heard a word about my lost bag. I have called the number they give you if you don't hear from them 6 or 7 times, each time you call  you get warned that because of high volume your call may take up to 3 hours. So I've waited already as mentioned 6-7 times only to get the same run around, that they have no new information on my bag. Today I tried their messaging system, and after a bunch of questions and answers they said here call this #? Well it's the same # that puts you on hold for hours and then doesn't solve a thing. Basically you pay over 2k for a ticket, they lose your bags and now your stuck as they really don't do any effort to help you find your bags.  So now it turns out that they say you have to have receipts for everything if you want claim reimbursement. All in all I feel like Delta really doest even care if I ever get my bag back.  Never will fly with them again."
210,10,11,July,2022,First Class,Detroit , Salt lake city      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Completely dissatisfied. Flight dl2230 from Detroit McNamara to Salt Lake City with connecting flight to Fresno. First of all the plane was set to leave early. After a few minutes of sitting the crew informed us that they were waiting for a few people to board. About 3 people come and we finally taxi. The plane again stops and the captain mentions something about another delay. At this point they tell us they know we have connecting flights and will do all they can. We arrive 20 minutes late. The connecting flight was already boarding. We have 10 minutes to run from A74 to b24 about a 15 minute walk. I run with 2 minutes to spare. Guess what the gate closed early. Why did one flight wait and the other leave early. And why do they expect you to walk 15 minutes in salt lake city.
211,9,10,July,2022,First Class,Colorado Springs , Salt Lake City , Atlanta   ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I am a Diamond Medallion and have been for the last 5+ years with over 1 Million miles with Delta, in other words a valuable customer. I normally do not write reviews but in this case the combination of gross negligence, incompetence and utter disregard for the ""customer"" deserves noting. My flight from Colorado Springs to Atlanta on July 9th was a series of delays and more importantly three mishandled interactions with the Diamond customer service representatives where my flight was changed without my knowledge or approval and a false representation where the agent stated a flight was cancelled as the justification behind the unilateral action when it was not (I watched it depart). Incompetence, deceit and unneeded chaos were the themes today - absolutely unacceptable! Delta has lost my business going forward - it is one thing to not be able to do your job but lying coupled with rude remarks takes it to another level."
212,1,9,July,2022,Economy Class,Minneapolis , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Absolutely outstanding service. First, they upgraded my Main to the First class. Second, we were offered hot meal on the flight of 2 hours 7 minutes. Totally unexpected. The meal was phenomenal - beef with vegetables, strawberry salad, desert and coffee. I wanted to see the new movie offer. But, my headphones jack was damaged. They offered any available seats to move on, which was not important. I will watch movie later. 5 minutes later, I was informed thy are awarding me a certain number of the frequent flier miles for inconvenience. This is not the first time. They did it before for delayed and cancelled flights. Than I purchase $5 wi-fi, which worked flawlessly the entire flight. The entire crew was phenomenal in all classes. Pilots were informative. Pretty much they reported every single stormy cloud and updated us on the times of arrival to Atlanta. I cannot thank them enough for this outstanding service, pleasant flight and courteous service from check in to the boarding, flight and speedy bags on arrival, which is happen very often in Atlanta that bags come to carousel before I come from the gates. Delta is the World class airline, that's sure."

As we took off there was a lot of turbulence. My daughter who was in front of me vomited all over her self as well as the back of the seat and floor. The attendant, Alexis, worked very quickly to clean up and assist in this situation. She moved passengers away from us so that did not have to deal with it. She quickly got my daughter into the bathroom and blocked it off so she could change clothes and wash up. Alexis made sure to give her a bag to keep the dirty clothes separate from everything else. As soon as my daughter returned to her seat Alexis made sure she had a ginger ale to calm her stomach. She was a godsend. "

My husband and I were traveling to see family. He is a Kidney Patient and was not feeling so well on the flight. His blood pressure kept fluctuating as we were flying. They gave him oxygen and helped to keep him calm. Thank you Denise and Amy for all you did to help us. Your kindness was immensely satisfying. God bless you both. He is doing much better and awaiting his transplant here in a few months. Keep doing what you do. Those guest are in good hands with them. Many blessings. Thank you Delta Airlines for all the help. All the attendants and helpers were all so nice and accommodating. Hope to see you all soon.

We'll I have to be at work Monday so I had to find someone to come get me from Birmingham. When you sell tickets please let people know they are purchasing a ticket at their own risk. Don't let them know after purchasing their tickets. They are alternative ways of travel. Tired and very disappointed with your service."
222,10,3,July,2022,Economy Class,Houston , Buffalo        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  In May of 2022 I had a Delta flight ticket. Flight was at 6:00 am. They had canceled the flight and sent a notification after 10:30 pm the night before where I already had gone to sleep. In the morning morning I received a notification that my flight is at 6:00am. I was a mile away from the airport in Uber I received another update that my flight is at 2:30pm. I was going to IAH to BUF. I decided to stay at the airport to take the changed flight. Flight was delayed several more times through the journey arriving at BUF nearly at MID-NIGHT (12:00am) where I was to arrive around 11:30am that morning. 2nd Issue: I bought another ticket from BUF to IAH in June of 2022. This time I had a conflicting schedule and could not fly that day and canceled the ticket 30 minutes after I purchased it for a full refund. I got a confirmation email saying refund confirmation request, then in another area of the DELTA App it says your case is being processed and refund should be in 7 days. I received a notification on Jun 20th of my flight being still active. I called Delta and they said it is being processed and there is nothing on my part to do at this time. Today I received a notification again that my flight is in 2 days. I called Delta again and this time the rep. tells me that I didn't cancel my flight and she just canceled it and sent a confirmation. As of today (7-3-2022) they are still holding on to my money since purchased in early June. I guess they mean it just like what they release in the toilet bowl daily.  I will never fly again with this airline."

I did not stress at first as Delta had always done right by us flying. I called and the agent tried to charge us $175 each extra for a flight the next day together. After cancelling our flight and leaving us stranded in a foreign country. I ended up having to leave our last day early to taxi to the airport an hour away as we were in playa del Carmen. I lost money on our afternoon shuttle as well as the $50 cab fare and our last day in Mexico. So angry and disappointed. They blamed weather- on a beauty clear day that every other airline seemed to be able to fly on. Disgusting.
224,1,2,July,2022,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  They made us wait for 12 hours due to plane maintenance.

Virtually no waiting in line to check-in, get through TSA or boarding. The crew was very friendly and helpful. The flights were smooth and arrived early. The passengers were quiet and respectful.

227,1,1,July,2022,Economy Class,Tucson , Saint Louis , Salt Lake City   ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta has disappointed me the last few times I have flown. Always canceling flights just maybe 2 hours before flight needs to leave. I had a 22 hour layover. They just paid for my hotel. No meals or anything else. They then just gave me $15 for the 2 days I was held up in a hotel. 2 days after I get home no one could find my flight. I tried fighting on getting all my money back. After 30 mins of arguing I was on the flight they just gave me 10,000 points. Very disappointed. When we were waiting for our flight the first night, they gave us hot water and snacks were all sugar. I never got any money back from what I had to spend with food. Delta I will never fly or recommend your airline again. Use to be my favorite."

Not a full flight, plenty of space for a carry-on and they took mine even though I paid extra to have it with me. I will never use this airline again. While sitting in my seat I canceled my American Express credit card because I never want to have any relationship with such a horrible company or with rude staff again."
229,1,30,June,2022,Economy Class,Seattle , Paris        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Seattle to Paris. Title of the review could be - Delta unethical practice of giving away your airplane seat - In January 2022, my wife and I booked tickets to fly to Paris in June 2022. One day before departure my wife received a text from Delta Airlines saying her seat in business class had been changed to a seat in the main cabin on row 33. Reason given in the text was change of flight schedule (which was not true) this was flight Delta 114. The price difference between the two seats was substantial but was not mentioned in the text. We tried to call Delta to understand the change but waiting time to talk to an agent was 2 hours, so we drove to Seattle airport to discuss at the airline counter. We went to Delta airlines and the Delta agent told us that we should discuss with Air France because the flight was booked through them. She also gave the true reason for the change and said, ""this happens all the time, we give priority to people with more seniority with the company (Delta)!"" So even though we booked our flight 6 months in advance we were booted from one of the seats a day before the flight because someone else needed it? We went to the Air France agent, and they told us they never do that (change a business class ticket for a main cabin ticket because someone need your seat). Air France staff was very professional and respectful, and we had to take another flight the next day with Air France."
230,1,29,June,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My husband and I flew to Seattle, WA on 6/9/22 for an anniversary trip. We try to fly Delta when we can because of the great customer service. This trip we were very disappointed. I purchased the tickets at the same time, but Delta did not seat us together, I asked at the airport if they could correct this and was told no. Since we couldn't sit together, I decided I would spend the 5 hours watching movies. Well my tv monitor didn't work, after having it reset I was able to watch a movie and then it stopped working again. The people next to me had no problems with their tv. After landing my husband said the same thing happened to his tv. Once we landed we could not get off the plane because there was no one there to hook the plane up to the airport. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for someone to arrive. Finally we got off the plane and went to pick up our baggage. Our luggage didn't show up along with about 20% of the other passengers. There was a gentleman standing next to us and he said he had a tracker on his luggage and it showed it was still at the plane. People started complaining about our luggage not arriving. Shortly after they announce on the intercom that they had forgot a cart of luggage at the tarmac. Of course it was pouring outside and everything was getting soaked. After almost an hour wait we found out that they did send out luggage, but to a different location. They could have announced to us that they were sending it somewhere else. I am so disappointed in Delta, this was a terrible start for our vacation."

The Courier picked up the passports and delivered them to Delta where they were scanned in and put on the plan. The package was then delivered to Delta Cargo in Seattle where it was then scanned in. From that point I don't know what happened, but the passports are missing. My husband and I had to miss our 36th anniversary cruise, because the airline lost our passports. I have spent over 35 hours on the phone with Delta and gone by the Delta Cargo offices to try and find my passports. No one can help me and actually no one is even trying to help me. I can't get anyone I speak to have a supervisor to call, email or contact me, It makes no sense at all, everyone that I have spoken to says they can't have someone contact me. Why not?"

It was her first time flying and we met our pilot in the Starbucks line before boarding.

Would not be surprised if we had a future pilot on our hands!"

We knew it would be very close to make our connecting flight in Seattle to SLC. We ran from our gate to the connection, only to hear that the door had just closed and that we were too late. We walked away, catching our breaths, defeated and in despair. Just as the saddening news and the realization of what was to come in having to change all of our plans, Kevin (from delta) yelled down the gateway to us, asking if we had come from Calgary. With a nod from us he pointed us back towards the gate giving us the joyous news that we would indeed be allowed on the aircraft. I was informed that the lady at the desk had communicated with the tower on our behalf and string were pulled somehow to re-open the doors and allow us on the aircraft. Very grateful to Delta for accommodating us today."
234,1,28,June,2022,Economy Class,Marquette , Portland , Detroit      ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Cancun to Atlanta. Our flight was cancelled at 1am. We didnâ€™t see the notification until 3am. The hotel we were staying at was booked out and they were nice enough to allow us to stay an extra night in our same room. Unfortunately, our room was priced up to $1500 because their peak season started. We had no other options in that moment to look for another hotel in a foreign country at that hour, and there were no other rooms available. We submitted a complaint, got a case number. No one got back to us ever. Two months and hours worth of phone calls later I finally get someone to work the case, only for them to tell me that Delta has a max of $500 cap for extra stay. We understand the need for a cap, but there are always outstanding situations. We were not trying to have an extra free night of fun or take advantage, we had responsibilities pending, it was a total nightmare. This entire experience left us feeling like flying anywhere with Delta is a huge gamble now. No one is safe with these flight cancellations. Delta needs to figure out another way to take care of their customers and offset the out of pocket expenses that are unplanned due to these cancellations. If you donâ€™t have the staff, donâ€™t sell the seats!"
235,10,28,June,2022,Business Class,Seattle , Paris , Stockholm      ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  We made reservations flying out of Marquette Michigan and no one told us Marquette is in a different time zone so we missed our flight. We called Delta who got us a flight out of Green Bay Wisconsin. Then they charged us 283.00 each to change the ticket. When we changed the city we were flying out of we had to change our return tickets as well and those were through American Airlines. They didn't charge us one cent to change our flights. The Delta airplane was filthy. Dirt and trash on the floor of the plane. Dirty hand wipes in the pockets on the seats. Filthy bathroom. The wifi didn't work. We will never fly Delta again.
236,10,27,June,2022,Economy Class,Minneapolis , White Plains       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Mobile App did not allow check-in. Did not show connecting flight. Did not provide information whom to contact in case you need assistance. I called the agent, wait was for 34 minutes. So, I opted for a call back. Did not hear from them in next 2 hours, while I was waiting at the check-in counter. Conclusion: Delta do not provide any assistance. Operations is the critical component of their business. I would care less if an airline avoids delays and disruptions (except in cases of extreme weather). For an international traveller, it is not east to navigate airports, or make alternative arrangements in a foreign country, that too in a situation where airport staff speaks language other than yours'. While booking the DeltaOne, my agent warned me that delta flights are often delayed. I gave it a shot nevertheless. And true to their reputation, Flight was delayed by 44 minutes in App, 1 hour at the checkin counter and 2 hours at departure. As First flight was delayed, I missed my connecting flight. The options I was given were: Fly by different carrier. But I have to claim baggage, go through security and checkin again. Catch is to do it in 1hour 15 minutes!  Wait at the airport for next flight (that was exactly after 12 hours and downgraded from business to economy).Leave my check-in bag with Delta and pick it up on return flight ! This made me really furious. I wonder if Delta and its partner has any sensitivity. So, I chose option b. And adding insult to injury, I was given 15 Euro complimentary food coupons. Talk about customer care. Delta is not transparent in their conduct or concerned about customer experience.  Ground Staff the most pathetic staff I ever witnessed.  The lady in-charge of ground affairs was outright rude. Did not even listen. I kept pleading for details, but she said she would help me later. I felt a bit arrogance in her attitude. And I did not understand where the staff kept disappearing intermittently. For two and a half hours that I was in checkin line (Sky priority is a joke), I noticed staff behind screen varied between 1 and 4. Perhaps Delta is short staffed. When I managed to reach check-in counter, the lady said I cannot check-in luggage as the deadline for baggage checkin is closed. So, either travel next day (which was not feasible for me) or take bag to the gate. Catch is, I had liquids in checkin bag. So, I had to throw them away. Remember, sometimes it is not about stuff but emotions attached to it. I had something special to me in the bag (Hence my resolve to avoid Delta as much as I can). The thing that made me furious is that flight stood at the gate for another 1hour 15 minutes after boarding completed. The most disgusting feeling was the way their staff looked at me when I showed I have DeltaOne. Perhaps, I did not look good enough for their ""Elite"" service. Delta's ground staff is indifferent, if not incompetent."

Airlines expect customers to plan for every eventuality but do not provide customers that same courtesy, like I don't know having backup attendants on call maybe instead of being as cheap as possible. This is very disheartening since the rest of the flight crew was on time without issues."

My experience began in Orlando with flight departing 2.5 hrs late due to â€˜overloaded cargo binâ€™. Clearly missed connection. Arrived at complimentary hotel 0100 with no restaurant or food. I as several others was tired hungry and angry. All I wanted was ONE delta employee to apologize Treat me with grace and understanding. Additionally i was not provided a toiletry bag nor food voucher and i was too exhausted to think about it until i arrived at the hotel at 0100. Upon my return to my gate the next morning i did go to the help desk and request toiletries and food voucher which was provided. Come on Delta i encountered at least 8 different delta employees and not one treated me as a customer who deserves a smile.  People driven customer focused culture - I think not. You failed me and several others last night. You failed to see me. You failed to hear me. I pray you get it right for the next time. For me there will not be a next time with Delta. This has happened too often, you no longer deserve my business. I could share more of this journey if you care to â€˜hear meâ€™. Correction the pilot as we left the gate in Orlando apologized."

My trip was postponed due to Covid. In the meantime, Delta canceled their direct flights to Bermuda and a 2 hour trip became a 6 hour trip. They told me I could cancel the 3 Delta flights and they would refund me $1800 so that I could apply that money toward my 3 Jet Blue direct flights. However, they only refunded me $183.04. I have reached out several times and their final response was as follows: ""Due to the write offs made on this booking to honor original rates, there is no additional compensation"" If they had told me from the beginning that I was going to lose out on money if I canceled the flights, I would have found a different destination. They told me they would honor my original prices and my travel agent conformed that she has that recorded."

First they postponed the trip to more than an hour to later to board us for nothing. Because shortly after, they deplaned us due to a mechanical failure. Later, they told us that they had a plane coming from Salt Lake City so we waited a total of 2 hrs to try board the other plane (overall 3 hrs in total) to be told that they did not had the flight crew to operate the flight. My flight got finally canceled after more than 3 hrs frustrating hours. The only compensation I got was $30 meal vouchers and a complimentary hotel Night that I didnâ€™t use because the queue was so long and I got the email so late at night that I already booked the hotel. To make matters worse, I had to get a flight back home to San Juan that departed two days after with another airline. I wonâ€™t fly with Delta again in my life !"
241,1,24,June,2022,First Class,Seattle , New York , Los Angeles    ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  They canceled my flight 3 hours before departure and put me on a flight that had a 5 hour layover when my original flight was nonstop. My original nonstop flight would have only been 3 hours. My new trip in total will be 12 hours this is a huge east of my time. They also did not offer any compensation for this huge inconvenience! They canceled because they did not have a crew to fly the plane! I booked this flight 3 months ago and they couldnâ€™t find a crew in that amount of time? Clearly they do not care about their staff or their customers.
242,1,24,June,2022,Economy Class,Miami , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United Arab Emirates, Trip Verified ,  This is by far my worst flying experience in my life and Iâ€™ve been flying since the age of 4 which is 40 years ago and Iâ€™ve flown with many international airlines across the globe. This airline is a joke doesnâ€™t even qualify to be a budget LLC. I flew with them 4 sectors all in first class including delta one. First leg was SEA-LAX first class in a very old 30+ years old B737 after boarding and take off and the pilot switch off the seat belt sign I asked the notorious cabin crew if I can use the toilet and I was the very first passenger to use whatâ€™s supposed to be the first class cabin toilet and it was filthy and floor full of water and when I informed the FA he said yes itâ€™s flooding. Prior to my departure Delta sent me via their app to choose my meals and since I have specific dietary requirements I choose whatâ€™s suitable for me. When the FA was offering the meals he came to me and with a very low and unclear tone he offered me what options they have and when I told him I have a special meal request he said we donâ€™t serve that on domestic flights so eventually I took the oat meal with some shea seeds which turned to be an awful non edible option. After landing and waiting for my luggage I found my suitcase was damaged beyond repair I went to Delta luggage service desk I spoke with the employee who was very unhelpful and not interested to be working she just did a form and gave it to me with a tracking number and till today after almost a month still I didnâ€™t hear from their customer service. My 2nd leg was from LAX-JFK supposed to be with B767-400 the newly refurbished delta one. As per Delta email prior to departure we need to be 2 hrs prior to departure at the airport which is 4am I was there on time and they said there is a dedicated lounge for delta one passengers . There was no one at the check in counters as they said they open by 4 am and to my surprise the Delta one dedicated check in lounge is just a partition of the check in area separated by a partition. We waited till 4:30am one one employee finally showed up and opened the partition and we did our check in finally. The only positive thing was the new delta lounge at LAX . Food options were horrible though. We boarded surprisingly to a very old dirty B767-300 with the old version of Delta one seats. Probably 25+ years old aircraft which was falling apart. Started taxing on time however for almost 1 hr the pilot was taxing around the airport and at 7 am he informed us we are going back to the gate as the plane developed a technical problem which need another hr of repair and we ended up sitting on board for another 2 hrs without even a glass of water or any interaction from the crew we eventually took off at almost 9 am 3 hrs behind our schedule and to my surprise the FA came to me and said you requested for a special meal and itâ€™s ready so they actually serve pre ordered meals on domestic flights. Anyways we landed in JFK almost 3 hrs behind schedule at 5pm instead of 2:15 and I had to rush to catch my 7pm appointment which was so stressful with NYC traffic. The other 2 flights were nothing special LGA-BOS and BOS-DCA weâ€™re both on old dirty EMB175 however weâ€™re very short flights. Conclusion never again on this joke airline. And they say Delta is one of the best carriers in USA.

There were only problems with the flights. Connecting flights did not wait. At the counters to change bookings, one employee after the other left and did not come back. Hundreds of passengers were still waiting. I've never experienced such cheek. Never again with this airline.  Das Personal an den FlughÃ¤fen ist unhÃ¶flich, nicht Kundenorientiert. Es gab nur Probleme mit den FlÃ¼gen. AnschlussflÃ¼ge warteten nicht. An den Schaltern zum Umbuchungen vorzunehmen ist ein Mitarbeiter nach den anderen weggegangen und nicht wieder gekommen.

Flight was delayed first by 2 hours. Then another hour. Then another hour. Then another. Then canceled. Only other option was to drive 15 hours, so we went to the Delta service desk, canceled rather than rebooked, and requested our checked bag to be returned to baggage claim. After spending two hours in baggage claim, speaking to an attendant for the second time finally yielded some information that the attendant apparently did none of the things he said he did, because our bag was already on another flight and our automatic rebook wasnâ€™t canceled. Seven miserable hours of our lives we wonâ€™t get back, incompetence at every level from the employees, and still a bag on another plane with no help on retrieving it besides a 1-800 number with a 2 hour waiting line. Unbelievable."

Then we arrive at the airport and find out it had been delayed another 20 minutes. No  problem we have a 2 hour lay over in Salt Lake City Utah. we get on the plane and they cancel service of drinks and snacks.  I open my tray table to discover there was food and crumbs and sticky stuff everywhere. I asked for it to be wiped off and the flight attendant handed me a 1 inch by 1 inch wrapped disinfectant wipe / we land at the airport and the start announcing that there are 80% of the flight that has connecting flights and we need to hurry. They drop us off in the middle of the tarmac and have us catch a bus to the terminal. We get to the gate and the door is shut and the time on the board says the plane is leaving in 20 minutes but the door is shut so we can't get on. I headed to the bathroom across the hall and by the time I get back I was told by my boyfriend that they came out and said they had room for 5 more. 5 loaded on and we were left behind to get shuttered to a hotel for the night, shuttered back to the airport in the morning. Delta could sell their flight tickets for a lot cheaper if they ran the business right but they have to charge more to compensate for all the double bookings, the hotel they have to pay for and travel they will reimburse because they can get it together. Then I get the text to see if that will help get us back on track and the only response I got from it was, ""my apologies I can only assist you in English"" I was speaking English! what a joke."

248,1,20,June,2022,Economy Class,Redmond , Cabo San Lucas      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The day prior to our flight from Nashville to Daytona Beach was cancelled. We were placed on a much later flight that would set us to miss an entire day of already-paid-in-full vacation. We were able to change the flight to an earlier, similar flight. Baggage drop was difficult. We arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early. We also paid an additional $200 to book a hotel next to the airport to ensure this early arrival. This would not have been necessary if not for Deltaâ€™s cancellation of our flight. Even with staying at the airport hotel and arriving nearly three hours prior to our flight, baggage check took almost two hours. Despite so many cancellations, Delta staff did not seem to be moving with any sense of urgency for their travelers. Once on our flight, we were set to arrive in Atlanta and connect to a flight to Daytona. When we landed, we discovered that our connecting flight was cancelled midair. We did not receive any notification of this change- no text or call. After speaking to customer service at the ATL airport, we discovered that there was only one other flight to Daytona, our destination. Staff said that it may also be cancelled be we are welcome to select that flight. Ultimately, we were placed on standby for Orlando flights. We were able to barely catch the next flight out. Three Delta staff members assured me my baggage would follow me there. It did not. Since we arrived at the incorrect destination, the rental car company charged us an additional $500 to provide us with a rental car in Orlando. I created a baggage claim with Delta Baggage Claim Customer Service in MCO airport. ^he agent interrupted me often and was very short with me. It was poor customer service that I did not appreciate. She assured me that my luggage would be placed on a flight to either Orlando or Daytona and then delivered to my hotel. Several hours later, my luggage was placed on a flight to Orlando. It has now been at the MCO airport for hours. I cannot reach anyone about delivery. It will be a three hour trip there and back to retrieve my luggage. As for tonight, I have no toiletries or clothes. I cannot even brush my teeth, change my undies, or even swim in a swimsuit because I have no luggage. Delta should be embarrassed and ashamed. As a company, they should not be booking flights that cannot take off due to staff shortages. I am not looking forward to our return flights at all. I am honestly worried these flights will be cancelled as well. I feel that we should receive significant compensation for our difficulty and additional costs due to Deltaâ€™s poor travel management skills. If they cannot make this right and make it up to us, I will certainly never fly Delta. I will also be sure to spread the word as much as possible."

Delta has been absolutely horrible to work with. No one was able to help us at the airport with rescheduling. Rather, we were giving a 1-800 number to call to reschedule our own flights. At 6:45 am I called Delta customer service. I was on the line for one hour and 47 minutes and during this time I did speak with an agent and she was not able to help us. She transferred us to her supervisor, and was disconnected after being on the line for almost 2 hours. We were still at the airport waiting to get rescheduled and still was told that no one could help us and to call the 1-800 number. I called back at 10:05 am and talked with another agent. I was on hold for one hour until I was told that she was not able to do anything, but would submit this to someone who was able to help us. Also, I was told a few times by customer service that there were over 2000 calls from customers that were waiting to be rescheduled and felt that we were one in 2000 and not that important. We were disconnected as well but she called us back even though Delta's protocol is to not call customers back that get disconnected from calls. Finally, by 2pm, our flights were finally rescheduled for the next day. This has been a horrible experience. Delta is awful to work with and I will never fly with them again. The fact that they had over 2000 people waiting on hold to get rescheduled and that I had to spend over 8 hours on the phone to get a flight reschedules is completely unacceptable. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. Don't fly Delta!!"

We were seated in seats 5C and 5D, the last row before comfort seating. For meal service we were offered one choice - WonderMeat burgers. Neither my wife nor I are vegetarians or vegan - my wife took one bite and said, ""Ick!"" I did not accept this non-choice and was offered a box with dried snacks and gummi bears! This is not First Class. If Delta cannot afford to offer all your First Class passenger a choice for meals, you do not deserve, and will not retain, your First Class passengers. Then, my video player did not work. This is a great example of ""shrinkflation"". Airline tickets today are 33% more expensive than this time last year, according to the WSJ. And yet, the service Delta provided on this flight was at least 33% worse than any other airline's First Class. Any of Delta's competitors would have done better than this. My conclusions - Delta Not First Class - we will definitely seek alternatives the next time we travel."

However, when I arrived in Seattle after booking with a whole new airline (Alaska Airlines) because my new flight times were delayed 5 hours and I wouldâ€™ve missed my connecting flight with Delta...my luggage was lost. I proceeded to make a lost baggage claim and Delta did not want to make a claim since I landed with Alaska. The lady at the counter lied and said it had arrived in Seattle but I forgot my Mac book (find my MacBook) was in my luggage and it never left Denver.

Their only excuse is â€œsystemâ€, ie things canâ€™t be fixed because the system says they canâ€™t, same system that added a random flight Iâ€™d never reserved nor paid for into my reservation, and caused my baggage fees to double because I need to pay extra for the flight Iâ€™m not taking nor have booked, from a place Iâ€™ve never visited. And itâ€™s not the fault of staff. Poor things tried their best to help me, but their â€œsystemâ€ and instructions basically left them helpless."

As an active duty military member I am able to ship my dog, and I had three agents verify everything was good to go. Show up for the flight and a member at the ticket counter stopped us after our bags had already been loaded and said he needed clarification on the regulation. He was on hold for over an hour, we missed our flight, and then concluded without reference that we would not be able to travel (I verified later that he was wrong). Because of that only half my family traveled while my daughter and I drove from SC to Cali in a rental. Days later I had to talk to three different reps (40 min hold time each) with none being able to get me a straight answer. After asking to talk to a supervisor, he finally confirmed that it was wrong and agreed to refund our follow-on flights. However, days later I have not seen the refund and was never sent the confirmation number. Do not trust this airline, will never fly with them again. Lost thousands of dollars with this that the military will not reimburse. Worst customer service I have ever experienced!"
258,1,16,June,2022,Economy Class,Phoenix , Oslo , Salt Lake City    ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks. The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket. I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch. But for a lot less money, $293 in my case, you can get Comfort Plus with 34 inch pitch and 17.2 inch width. Very disappointed with value for money, I would not waste my time paying for this seat, you may think differently of course."

Four months later, Delta then changed our original flight time to 5 hours earlier for no apparent reason - with very long layovers. We immediately called Delta so try to fix this, but were told to wait until 2 months before our trip started to rebook to a later start time, and that changing the start time would require yet another phone call - which we did. After 35 minutes on hold for the 2nd time, the agent couldn't rebook our flight using Delta's internal computer system - for some strange and unknown reason - so were transferred to Delta's ""Manual Servicing"" department. And we were told that changing to a later time - which was very close to our original start time - ""may"" result in incremental charges of over $400 for each of the two flights we were trying to change back to original. 60 more minutes on hold with the ""Manual Servicing"" department - then we were disconnected. We gave up. - never got the problem sorted."
260,1,15,June,2022,Economy Class,New York , Charlotte       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The first leg of the flight from DFW to Atlanta was nice. My husband and I landed a few minutes early, however, once we stepped off the plane, everything changed. We endured the worst airport experience ever in our combined 109 years. We had 1 hour to deboard and take the train to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Panama City, FL (ECP). After rushing to get to the other terminal, we were disappointed to see on the screen that our flight to ECP had been canceled. About that same time I received a text from Delta that due to the inconvenience, they would provide us with a complementary hotel room from a list of hotels they provided and a complementary meal. I attempted to reserve a room at one of the hotels provided, only to find that all within 30 miles of the airport were booked. We made our way back to the main terminal and proceeded to stand in a long and winding line at the ticket counter. By this time, it was about 10:30 pm. While waiting in line, I checked the Delta website for the next flights going to ECP. There were no more flights that night, all flights the following day were sold out, and all were sold out two days later except for the late flight that had a few seats remaining. I called Delta Customer Service thinking this may be quicker than waiting in line at the airport, however, the wait time to speak with a CSR was 3+ hours. After waiting in line for over 2 hours and next in line, a Delta staff member walked by the line and asked what we needed. I explained our situation that our connecting flight was canceled, according to website all flights were sold out the next 2 days and none of the complementary hotels had rooms available and was told ""you'll have to wait until next week to get to FL."" About that time, another Delta staff member said they were closing the line down because it was past time for them to go home. We proceeded to the baggage area and waited another hour in line to get our bags and were advised we could not get them that they would be on the 8 am flight to ECP and we could get them whenever we got to ECP, By this time it was 1:30 am. We had to find our own hotel and transportation ($230 + $60 to hotel + $30 from hotel) and planned on renting a car and driving so we didn't lose 2 more days of our vacation. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we returned to the airport and stood in line at Dollar Rental for 2.5 hours before deciding to go back to the airport terminal to see if they had any seat cancellations to ECP or other airports within 2 hours. We waited in line 2 more hours to finally get a Delta staff member who actually was trying to help. She was able to get me on a late afternoon flight and my husband on a flight that evening. I received a $100 credit from Delta for the inconvenience (my husband did not) and $15 voucher for a meal. But, considering we spent $320 on the hotel and transportation to and from hotel, and lost a day of vacation, we are out several hundred. Not to mention I canceled the return flight and rebooked on SW and only received a partial credit. Although I realize there is a shortage in pilots and many flights are being canceled, there needs to be a process set up to ensure those whose flights have been canceled are rescheduled on flights as soon as possible, instead of standing in line after line and not getting anything accomplished. Most importantly, staff in ATL need training on what customer service is, specifically, courtesy and professionalism."

She then said once doors closed I cannot board. I said they just closed now. She gave me the best flight at 448 which was fully seated unless someone didnâ€™t show up. I stayed there and luckily one person didnâ€™t come. 8 min before take off I said can I board since he is not here? The same female said no Iâ€™m still going to wait for him. I then said but I arrived 12 min before and you didnâ€™t allow me. She ignored me and then told me I cannot board and the last flight is canceled.

My other flight was delayed for 4 hrs I was late for my medical treatment in Turkey. They lost my bags and one of them was never found. I will not ever fly with Delta again in my life very bad experience. They said that plane was hit by lightning while flying to Detroit and that needs maintenance. They didn't have back plans to replace the plain until midnight we were supposed to be leaving at 0845 we didn't leave Detroit until 1 am very bad.

The flight in Roanoke, VA was delayed for two hours, and the customer service representatives at the gate messed up our connection flights in Atlanta. We paid for comfort plus seats when we arrived in Atlanta they have already gave our seats to other people, and made us wait for over 10 min saying that the boarding passes are standby. When we boarded the airplane they made my wife to set apart from us and me and my son sat at the end of the airplane, when I said we paid for comfort plus seats they said call customer service they will help you. Finally when we landed in Houston they said my wifeâ€™s name isnâ€™t on the list for wheelchair and made her walk all the way until we left the airport with our wheel walker."

My mother is currently sitting on tarmac waiting for the air traffic control to create flight plans or arrangements to take off because they didn't properly plan the flight. She missed my wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner because they changed flight plans 9 different times! She has had to change car rental twice and has had to pay 2 separate fees associated. She was given a $15 food voucher! Not to mention my Aunt couldn't get into her hotel because my moms name was the only one listed for check-in.
269,9,11,June,2022,Economy Class,Minneapolis , Hartford Bradley        ,Direct Flight,Business,France, Trip Verified ," I booked a flight on Delta from Geneva to Boston. The flight was operated by KLM. In-flight service was very good, however my baggage never showed up in Boston. I was told the only way to file a claim was to do so online. The only way to file a claim online is with the record locator. I have my original Delta record locator, but this is not recognized by KLM, and after 3 hours of hold time and speaking with Delta representatives, I am not able to obtain the KLM record locator. So, I have lost luggage with all of my stuff and absolutely no way to get any information or to communicate with anyone about it. I'm extremely tired, frustrated, and (increasingly) angry."

I need to express that I am extremely disappointed in Delta - I book a flight for me and my brother 5/21/22 to leave MSP at 6.05am and it was canceled. I was assured that they have moved me to the next flight leaving same day at 10.30am. I checked into that flight, show up to the airport to find out that flight was also canceled after sitting in line for almost 2 hours, and I was told there was nothing that could be done. I was flying out to Connecticut to purchase an RV. I had the party waiting to pick us up and to make the purchase. I needed to explain that my flight was canceled again after arranging the pickup time again with them due to the first canceled flight. I have still not received my refund for my brother nor me. I was told that my refund would go back on the same form of payment, which was my credit card. As of right now I have not received a refund, I will end up paying interest on a flight that I never got to take and I looked very stupid to the party I was purchasing the RV from. I am sure they thought what a fraud I was! I have filed a complaint, I have filled out a refund form and have received no communication back. I will be sure to think twice about booking my future travels through Delta."

Then I called, an extremely rude women told me I only have one choice to travel, with 3 flight connection, and a risky 50 mins flight connection time. Then they made a delay again, a lost my flight connection. The extra seat with space for legs 100$ they put me in the middle, the worst place even, and they not even give the refund back, so why the charge extra for something they will not give to you? Food has no option, it was a pasta with no meat and a cheap tomato sauce! This time, I rather take a flight to an other country and travel back home with British Airways!"
273,1,7,June,2022,Economy Class,Tampa , San Antonio , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Nashville to Richmond. I have had the most stressful, awful, inconsiderate experience with Delta Air lines. I am a Delta sky mile customer and let me just say I will be closing that account! My flight from my first destination, I missed due to check in! Here I am 4 days later and my flight has been delayed FOUR times! Iâ€™ve voiced my concerns to 4 different Delta employees about my flight being delayed and my concerns. NOT ONCE WAS I OFFERED any type of services to better my situation. Not a I can find you another flight or I can give you book you a room to stay in due to the flight being canceled. Youâ€™re pretty much left on the side with no answers or hope to making it back home with your family. These folks show no type of care about their customers!

I had surgery and was going to fly in an exit seat ($50) so I had some extra leg room. I paid for the upgrade, the flight got cancelled, and I got put into economy on another flight with no refund for the upgrade. The flight number was the same as the one that got ""cancelled"". What the heck? They can just take your seat upgrade money, ""cancel"" a flight at will, and then reinstate the flight while keeping your upgrade fee. This is so immoral. I called and was told ""well we tell you that the seat fee is non-refundable when you buy it."" I'm like ""yeah, I'm sure it's on your 288 page list of policies you expect us to review."" I'm so sad. Now I'm 6 ft tall and post surgery in a middle seat. I will never fly Delta again. This is a scam."

278,1,4,June,2022,Economy Class,Chicago , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  In the past 5 hours I have dealt with 4 different agents and 2 supervisors. I had booked a flight from Detroit to London and tonight I went in the app to see if there was a flight at the same price or cheaper without a layover. I found a flight with a shorter layover leaving later in the day at half the price I had paid round trip. When I tried to change the flight myself the app and website kept timing out. I contacted delta to have them switch my flight manually, providing screenshots showing the price along with a screen recording as well. I was told that there was a different price on their end and would not honor the price on their own website / app. Complete false advertising. On top of that one of the supervisors I spoke to was so incredibly rude. She told me they could not honor the price as the connecting flight was through virgin Atlantic (a sky team member). I asked if instead she could put me on a delta flight at that price and she laughed. I have flown Delta my entire life and after this I will not fly with them ever again. Be aware of their bate and switch tactics."
279,10,4,June,2022,Economy Class,San Francisco , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Worst flight ever. First, they took my carry on at the gate saying there was no space left on the plane, but when I got on there was plenty of overhead storage left. Then, when we landed, they held us on the plane for almost an hour because there wasnâ€™t a gate available to park the plane. I used to think Delta was the best airline, but their standards have definitely slipped."

The pilot was nice and professional. The flight attendants were friendly and professional. I will definitely use Delta airlines again. The only problem I had was my checked baggage was paid for in advance but I was charged again because it didnâ€™t show in the system.
281,1,1,June,2022,Economy Class,Seattle , San Francisco       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  I have never had such poor service while flying. Check in at Orlando airport extremely slow and we missed our flight. The check out person absolutely no personality and absolutely rude. He asked why didnâ€™t we say something to someone about the time of our flight? I said no one came to us on line until after 7 am. Our flight was leaving at 708am. Then they put us on 3 different flight so we can get to our destination sometime tonight. Itâ€™s only 8 in the morning so we should hit our destination in about 12 hours if we are lucky.  We should at least get quality service.

283,8,1,June,2022,Economy Class,Key West , Birmingham , Atlanta     ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Flying with Delta Airlines was the worst travel experience I've ever had. Both connecting flights to and from Rome were such a far distance away from the arrival gate. We had to take a shuttle, go through customs again and literally run to the gate. We almost missed the connecting flight. When we arrived in Rome, our bags were not in baggage claim, so we wasted two hours waiting in line to fill out forms regarding our lost luggage. Then we had to wait two full days before our bags arrived. We had the same experience on our way back from Rome to LAX. Again, we almost missed our connecting flight because the gate to our connecting flight was such a far distance, and not enough time to go through customs and take a shuttle. And AGAIN they lost our luggage. To make things even worse, they delivered the wrong bag to my house. I am beyond frustrated and angry! I would not recommend flying with Delta! "

Luggage was loaded for some other 1:00pm flight, then moved to concourse for evening flight. We decided to drive, but had to wait 4.5 hours for luggage, despite filing a claim for luggage at 10am immediately after landing. Had to track down Delta supervisors to get it back. There were several other passengers with the same problem--luggage being sent to random flights after original flight cancelled. No other airline has ever lost our luggage; Delta has lost my luggage 2 other times, despite always being clearly tagged. We do not find Delta staff helpful, with few exceptions, & we have to go find ones who do care to help. We have decided to pay more to avoid flying Delta in the future & we purchase tickets for not only us, but for entire family vacations. Our vacation flight was from Indianapolis to Key West FL, Key West to Birmingham AL& return trip to Indianapolis."

286,1,29,May,2022,Economy Class,San Diego , Vancouver , Seattle     ,Couple Leisure,Canada, Trip Verified ," San Diego to Vancouver via Seattle. I experienced the most devastating trip with the Delta Air Lines. They canceled our flight without providing any reasons with a short notice of 5 hours prior to departure. They booked us with an alternative flight for the next day which did not work for us since our work obligation needed us to come back home the same day. I started communicating with an agent online and requested to rebook us with an alternative flight to arrive home the same day. They rebooked us with a different airline. They did not provide any confirmation number or ticket number until I requested them. We went to the SAN airport feeling happy that we successfully rebooked our flight. When we checked the ticket number that Delta provided us online with the new airline we realized that they booked us with a flight with no room! We checked again with Delta at the airport, and without receiving any apology, they tried to book us with another available flight. I asked them now that you booked us with a different airline, how can I ask to reimburse the fees that I paid for baggage check in and seat selection yesterday. They responded that you may request online after the trip is completed. We nearly spent 12 hours at the airport/flight until reaching home for a flight that suppose to take 3 hours. Our baggage was lost and it took us three days to receive it. Then I started processing the reimbursement for the baggage and seat fees with Delta that we have never been provided due to the flight cancelation. I could not pull up the information online and get my e-receipts online using my confirmation number upon arriving home! I had to go to the airport and inquire there. I spent nearly 5 hours at the airport to speak to an advisor which eventually she told me that they are unable to support me since the trip is completed unlike what they promised at the time of departure. They provided me a phone number for care assistance. I called them at least 5 times each time waited on the phone between 2-3 hours to be supported. They asked the ticket number and asked me to stay on the phone for a short while which took forever and they hanged up from their end! I would never ever considering travelling with the Delta Air Lines and I highly recommend the travelers to read the reviews online and think twice before booking with this flight."
287,3,29,May,2022,Economy Class,Phoenix , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Well, I use to fly Delta all the time. This trip might be the last go. They cancelled my first flight with no notification. None. Called the Delta helpline, 3 hour wait. The wife stayed online while I got to the airport to try to talk to an agent. None of this worked so had to book with a different airline at a higher cost. Delta refused to pay the difference, which I understand business model you would be losing money if you took care of the customer. They gave us a 100 dollar credit to fly with Delta again, while we spent over 300 dollars more to get to where we were going. The kicker, it happened on the way home as well. Iâ€™m guessing it will be the same result. Some sub-par compensation for a terrible experience."
288,10,28,May,2022,Economy Class,Detroit , Kansas City       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I've been waiting for my baggage to arrive since Tuesday. It's stuck in Detroit and I may never see it at this point. I was told it would be expedited and hasn't when they finally located it. I've called every day and been into the airport in person and the most they would do is message the airport, when I asked if they could call as I need my things, they told me I had to call myself as they could be bothered. Worst customer service ever. I may never get my back at this point, or if I do it definitely won't be within a week of when it was actually supposed to arrive. If you use this joke of an airline, carry on or you may never see your luggage again."
289,1,28,May,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , San Antonio     ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,  Flight delayed. Flight cancelled. Hotel room confirmed by Delta.

290,1,28,May,2022,Business Class,Albuquerque , Los Angeles , Honolulu     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  The absolute worst airline. My daughter was flying home from Albuquerque to Hawaii where she is a student with her service dog. Hawaii requires a veterinarian note on a certain day to arrive or the dog goes to quarantine, which would have ruined him as a service dog. Due to Delta incompetence the connecting flight was missed, Delta would not put her on a different flight or airline. I had to buy her a last minute $700 ticket to get home from another airline. Avoid these clowns!"
291,1,28,May,2022,Economy Class,Dublin , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," The 8.5 hour flight from Dublin to Atlanta was subpar. The flight attendants never came around to see if we needed anything. I watched the flight attendant sleep throughout almost the entire flight through the screen (pic attached). I wish I could get paid for sleeping on the job. The pillow others and myself received were not sealed in plastic and were used and dirty, and the blanket was a tablecloth. The food was so bad, TV dinner I would toss in the garbage if I was home. If you wanted a snack or a drink (barely any options), you were told to retrieve it yourself. When I asked if there were more than three snacks to choose from, which were pretty bad, the flight attendant told me that's all the airline would give them. Delta Air Lines really needs to step up and treat their customers as if they care about them."
292,1,27,May,2022,Economy Class,Boston , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We were ready to end our vacation and our flight was canceled. We have to go to another airport to get home. Which we can deal with, but now budget is charging us $250 to take our rental to another airport. So thanks Delta for screwing us over. We are not your rich patrons. Now we are broke and headed home. At least they got us a flight before we lost our rental and room and board. If I had to sleep at the airport this review would be 2x worse!"

When I attempted to then use the visa card I can't purchase flights with it! Somewhere in the small print it states that it can only be used for purchasing items from a list of 74 branded locations like Bass Pro Shop, Eddie Bauer, etc. I was on my way to my mother's funeral and was planning on using this money to help get my Dad a ticket to come see me and help him through his grieving process. Absolutely outrageous."
294,1,26,May,2022,Economy Class,Detroit , San Francisco       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  They canceled our flight (DL-2582) 3 hours before departure and will not cover the cost to rebook, they wanted me to pay an additional $1000 to reschedule for the same day for a flight that would have left 9 hours later and taken 12 hours longer than originally paid and planned for months ago. Delta will refund the cost of flight and hotels booked but it will take at least 10 weeks."
295,1,26,May,2022,Economy Class,Reno , Ft Lauderdale       , Salt Lake city   ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Honesty is very rare, and my travel debacle with Delta the last two days shows it to be non-existent with every employee I interacted with.  My flight from Reno was cancelled with no notice. Employee Lie #1-you should have received an email about cancellation. Employee Lie #2-there is only one flight leaving tomorrow, so you're stuck till then(there were, in fact other flights later in the day with other carriers-which they booked for me after spending 30 minutes on the phone). Employee lie#3-you'll have plenty of time to make your connection. LAX will have you leave the terminal and go through security to get to your next gate-missed my flight. Employee Lie#4 and 5-we will refund your AMEX card, but you can only call about it after you have completed your flights, so nothing gets messed up on your present flight.(your contract actually states that once you complete a flight, no refunds will be given). I was told this two times by two different employees, so it counts as two more lies, and clearly demonstrates the policy is to lie about refunds, so they have their ass covered once you take the flight. Lie#6-we have re-routed your bags to Atlanta so you will have them when we put you up in a hotel for the night(an honest baggage specialist explained the fact that isn't even possible, once they are checked, they go to your final destination) Lie #7-just go to customer service after you ""get your bags in Atlanta"" and you'll get a hotel voucher. ""I put a note in the system"". Nope, bags aren't here and customer service doesn't know what you're talking about. Finally, a kind soul baggage specialist took pity, and picked up the phone to the local hotel, and said ""we have another one"", and got us a hotel. For all my trouble, spending 36 hours instead of 6, being routed literally all over the United States, losing over $1500 in extra costs and lost wages. I get some vouchers for free Delta Flights!"

Delta flight was late and an early flight turned into a super late flight. We were bullied into getting a Delta flight from JFK to Paris and lost our booked seating. I booked through Air France and was supposed to fly on Air France but Delta screwed everything up. Avoid any connections that go through Delta, they will ruin your plans. Please post your bad experiences with this airline people need to be informed."
297,1,25,May,2022,Economy Class,Oklahoma City , Atlanta        , Cleveland     ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My husband and I booked Comfort + three months ago, and they completely changed everything: our flights were from 8am and land at 2pm in Cleveland, Ohio. They moved our first flight to 7am and our last flight to land in Ohio at 5pm. Not only that, but they also split my husband and I up in the process of consolidating for their convenience. So my travel time extended by 4 hours and I donâ€™t even get to sit with my husband. Absolutely not happy,Delta, I am finished with you, you are as bad as the rest of them."
298,1,24,May,2022,Economy Class,Northwest Florida Beaches , Madison      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta canceled my 6am flight the morning of the flight, with no prior notice and zero options to rebook same day. The earliest they could fly me home was 26 hours later and they made no attempt to find me a different combination of flights to get me back same-day. They also denied paying for an extra day at my hotel, a rental car or anything to accommodate my extra time in FL citing their â€œinclement weather policyâ€. American Airlines can fly me back through the same connection city today, though, so clearly weather isnâ€™t too much of a concern for them. Very poor customer service and general cancellation policy, I wonâ€™t be flying with them again."
299,3,23,May,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Omaha        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Imagine not scheduling pilots for a flight and cancelling it after everyone is ready to board the plane. Then, find out Delta has cancelled 4 other flights and having to wait in line for customer service for 5 hours. Only to find out that instead of a direct flight you'll have to spend 12 hours flying the next day. The Delta experience. Avoid this airline at all costs."
300,2,23,May,2022,First Class,Jamaica , Detroit , New York     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Something changed since I used Delta last, and it wasnâ€™t for the better. They missed my connection 2 days ago, and Iâ€™ve been living in the NY airport ever since. Luckily my luggage was forwarded on home somehow. Which means Iâ€™m wearing the same underwear I was when I left. Bumped from every flight til the last one of the day each night. Which then gets cancelled right before they close for the day. But at least they let you sleep on the floor while you wait for the next shift to start. No help or advice from any of the staff, other than a $15 voucher for the airport at the end of each night. But the food options close up about the same time you get the voucher. Never thought Delta could make Spirit look like they have their act together."
301,1,22,May,2022,Economy Class,Ft Myers , Detroit       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  On Saturday, May 21, at 12 noon, my wife and I arrived at the Fort Myers terminal, already checked in on Delta DL 17.13 to Detroit. We looked for the Gate Number, it said ""Cancelled""? (there were no problematic weather conditions) I went over to the Delta desk. The agent told me it had been cancelled but he did not know why. I asked him what we should do, He said ""Call the Delta 1 800 number"". We did and waited over an hour, we finally got an agent and their best offering was an American Airlines flight on Monday at midday. (2 days later!). No reason given, I saw that Delta had cancelled another flight that same afternoon. Young families were left stranded. I ended up booking a flight myself on Southwestern Airlines the next day. No Notice via email or text, No reason given, No help provided at the airport. A disgraceful treatment of passengers."
302,1,22,May,2022,First Class,Huntsville , Milwaukee , Atlanta      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Delta canceled my flight with less than 24 hours notice via text and email. We were at my sisters wedding which made the day difficult trying to be online and celebrate. 3 hours online and nothing except next day to Chicago. Our destination was Milwaukee. Same thing next day. We got â€œoh wellâ€ from front desk staff we did what we could. We are working people with schedules just like all the other travelers Delta did this too. Told us to go to United for refund. I checked with United and they said no. We borrowed a car and drove several hours. United not giving us vouchers. Beyond disgusted. Delta 2399
303,1,22,May,2022,Economy Class,New York La Guardia , Milwaukee       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Sad to say that Delta isn't alone with their poor customer service. Today I realized that I would get to my destination too late to pick up my dogs. I wanted to move a first class ticket on a 3 PM flight to any class in a noon flight. I first tried online. the Delta site said that a flight change needed to be handled on the phone. I called the number listed - and the wait for an agent was 3 hours. That was understandable a year or two ago, in the midst of COVID panic, but now that flights cost 3 times more than they did then, one would think that hiring customer service agents would be a priority. Speaking of priority, it shouldn't matter but I've had my 'sky priority' membership for over 25 years. So I go to the airport, to the gate where the flight from LGA to MKE was in the boarding process. Great! Nobody is at the counter, where two attendants are standing, one who is talking on the phone and laughing. I ask the other one if I can get on the flight, changing my full cost, first class ticket to any seat in the plane. She says 'I don't know. You have to ask that person', pointing to the gate for a flight to Bangor Maine, where one person was in front of a line of 10 people. I walked over to the line but it was clear I'd never make it in time. I walked back to a Delta service counter - a huge line with two agents behind the counter. My wife they tried to speak to the agent at the MKE gate, and she waved her away and said 'too late!' No 'sorry, we can't now' or 'let me see what I can do'. I had looked on the app saw that there were seats available - even two in first class. I used to always insist on Delta for any flight. They are just as bad as the worst airlines out there - even for long-time customers who are willing to pay for a fully refundable ticket. And their flight attendants complain about 'respect'?"
304,4,22,May,2022,Economy Class,Newark , Columbia        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Cancelled our flight just 4 hours before departure. Rebooked for the next day. Desk staff were unable to provide anything other than a 15$ meal voucher. Manager was unable to provide a hotel voucher despite the cancellation resulting in an overnight stay because the next earliest flight was the next day. Fast forward to the next day, go to check bags. Rebooked flight was with another carrier. The partner carrier canâ€™t check the bags to the final destination because Delta has to release the ticket to them. Proceed to wait over 30 minutes with customer service in order to get a rep so we can get our bags to our final destination. A true nightmare of a travel situation. Do not fly Delta. Their customer service is slow, disorganized, and provides too little help, too late. Their operations are just as chaotic and the one who suffers the most is the customer."
305,1,22,May,2022,Economy Class,Nashville , Warsaw , Paris      ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  When we arrived at the airport to start our trip the automated kiosk directed us to an agent. To our surprise the agent told us that we have to have vaccination record or negative COVID test before he can give us boarding documents. We did not have such thing. I informed him that our final destination is Poland which does not have such restrictions or requirements on this date of travel. I verified that with Department Of State official website. He checked with colleague and insisted that our transfer in Paris have such requirement - European Union. I argued that we are not going to France. We are not leaving the airport. It is transit only. He did not change his denial of our boarding passes. In desperation we hired Lyft, went to two Walgreens locations and $ 357.86 later came back to the airport with negative PCR COVID test results. With limited internet and help from gate agents in JFK we confirmed that such requirement was false!"
306,1,22,May,2022,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , New York      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This was my first time flying Delta Airline and 0/10 I would recommend. This was the worst travel experience I have ever had and I travel for vacation at least once a month! I will never fly Delta Airlines again. The flight was overbooked, yet again, and it was delayed by almost 2 hours. They wouldnâ€™t even share with guests why the flight was delayed when the weather was perfectly fine and there were no storm warnings. The planes are so little that no one is actually allowed to bring a carry-on bag, not literal but we were forced to put our carry on bags under the plane. A flight that was supposed to leave at 5:45 left at 8pm ! This was such a drag but Jeff - one of the flight attendants, was super nice and friendly. My overall rating is a 1 star because I wasnâ€™t allowed to give 0 stars."
307,1,21,May,2022,Economy Class,Boston , Newark ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Do not fly Delta. They cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before we were supposed to leave and rebooked me on a flight from Boston to New Jersey to Miami in which I wouldnâ€™t get in until midnight and extended my returning flight an extra day I didnâ€™t have. Customer support has a 3 hour + wait time, hoping I can get my money back."
308,1,21,May,2022,Economy Class,Kauai , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Absolutely terrible customer service. Initial agent outright lied and said we would not miss our connection. We knew we would so tried to book a later flight. He wouldnâ€™t allow it. In Seattle agent said we were booked on Alaska flight to SLC only to find out at the gate they hadnâ€™t transferred the funds. So we missed that one. Just terrible.
309,2,21,May,2022,Economy Class,New York , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Iâ€™ve been flying with various airlines for years. Every airline that I can remember offers one free checked baggage. Having experienced that precedent, I wouldâ€™ve thought it would be the same for Delta. As I was checking in, I asked a woman for help. She proceeded to be very rude, condescending and ended up walking away from me mid conversation. Itâ€™s overpriced and not worth being treated rudely. Iâ€™m definitely going back to Jetblue where the personnel and kind and patient."
310,1,21,May,2022,Economy Class,New York , Orlando       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Boarded flight after an hour delayed. After hearing the excuse about weather ect I understood. We taxied to the runway where we waited an hour and ten at which point we had to make room for other planes to take off. We soon ""had"" to head to the gate where we waited another 20 min to get a sky bridge operator. Once we got off the plane they noted crew rest issues and the flight would have to be canceled. They told us to head to customer care which I did, where I waited 6 hours to talk to someone. The only option was a flight the next day at 6pm. Mind you it's already midnight. The staff could care less about customer care. We were provided nothing and was told it is what it is. My wife and I slept on the floor of a dirty airport terminal with no blanket or any accommodation. Delta never again, the lack of respect and communication was the worst experience I have ever witnessed in my life.  No voucher or even a pillow or blanket so sleeping on the floor could be bearable."
311,1,21,May,2022,First Class,Atlanta , Manchester , Orlando      ,Business,United Kingdom, Trip Verified ,"  A disgrace of an airline! The flight to Orlando was delayed by two hours which meant we missed our connecting flight this was due to there being no pilot! We then got rerouted to London which is the other side of the country to Manchester they then lost both of our bags on this route. Following on from this they closed our ticket so we had to pay our own fare back to Manchester on the train and we were told that â€˜Delta do not cover these costsâ€™ I am appalled by their service, staff and attitude towards customers they are by far the worst airline Iâ€™ve ever dealt with I will never fly on a delta flight again. To add to this as we walked through the airport multiple flights were delayed and over 20 people on our flight lost their luggage also. I have never been more appalled by an airline or even a service."
312,1,21,May,2022,Economy Class,Denver , Portland , New York JFK    ,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Do not fly Delta. It pains me to say this, but I have never had a worse experience than I am having today with Delta. As a platinum medallion sky miles member everything is normally great and enjoyable. Not today. Delta had an equipment malfunction on the plane today, set the flight back several hours, we were never given any updates, and after 5 hours of sitting around they canceled the flight with no other routes available today. They pretty much trapped hundreds of people in the airport, I am now forced to sit around 15 hours for the new flight tomorrow morning (no exaggeration, I am delayed 15 hours due to their equipment malfunctions). No hotel voucher, no care or service, I have never felt more stranded, held captive, and abandoned all at once. Delta is horrible, and their service and handling of such issues is atrocious. I am stranded in one of the biggest cities with no hotel, no back up route to leave on, and they are holding my bag in the cargo hold so I can not even get it and drive to my location. Delta's service has never been worse, and this is the most absurd event I have ever been part of. If you want to get some where on time, do not use Delta. This has ruined an important business trip, and I am never going to use Delta again."
313,1,21,May,2022,Economy Class,Greenville/Spartanburg , San Antonio , Atlanta     ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," First flight cancelled, rebooked for 6 hours later. That flight was delayed by an hour, once on board we're told the APU (Auxiliary Power) isn't working so there's no air on board prior to engine start up. Stifling hot on board and Delta could not care less. The absolute worst service in the industry."
314,1,20,May,2022,Business Class,Greenville/Spartanburg , San Antonio , Atlanta     ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Started with problems with my TSA Pre-Check not being applied, took 3 hours and cost $50 to resolve. Plane boarded late and as of typing this review we've been stuck on the tarmac for 45 minutes with a mechanical issue, air is working intermittently and all we keep getting told every 15 minutes is that they're still working on it. No offer of refreshments or any consideration while they leave us to roast. Horrible experience."
315,1,20,May,2022,Business Class,Atlanta , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This is not about a past flight but an upcoming one. We were scheduled on Delta in Business Atlanta to Chicago round trip 18-19 June. Just received word that our return flight on 19 June was cancelled and we were moved to an earlier flight in the day. Since this is in the middle of the event we were attending in Chicago, it means we have to rebook for the next day, pay for an extra night in the hotel plus meals. We have been Skymiles Medallion members for years, and this is how they are treating us now. If the numbers donâ€™t make for a flight, then the passengers are left up a creek. What if I had to be at work that Monday? Delta, you are not my favorite airline right now."
316,1,20,May,2022,Economy Class,Spokane , Las Vegas       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  My husband and I booked round trip tickets from Spokane, WA to Las Vegas. Our first flight was cancelled without reason given and lost our comfort plus seats we paid for. Flight attendants on the way back from Las Vegas to Spokane were rude to other passengers and sarcastic when a passenger was attempting to place their luggage in an overhead compartment. I have flown Delta as well as other airlines dozens of times in my military career and for personal travel, but have never experienced flights being cancelled without a valid reason or had flight attendants be rude to passengers. When leaving from Spokane Airport the women working the counter at Delta were unprofessional and were clearly irritated that we were checking in for our flight. We were the only ones standing in line, 3 women were at the kiosks, but none of them wanted to call us up. Finally, after they all looked at each other, one of them called us up, but was unpleasant with us. I will make sure to never book future flights with Delta."
317,1,18,May,2022,Economy Class,Boston , Athens , Paris      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Boston to Athens via Paris. I was boarded and unboarded twice, missed my connection, got lied to about my layover saying I didnâ€™t have to go through security when I did, almost missed my second flight, and lost my baggage which had been a carry on they insisted on checking on my first flight. It has been over 48hrs and I have not gotten this bag. I have vital medication in the bag which I cannot access. Furthermore, I have been lied to by customer service about where my bag is. I have not gotten any compensation or even simple communication from them. This is the worst flight experience I have ever - had and I am an avid traveler."
318,1,18,May,2022,Economy Class,Detroit , San Diego       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  It was a nightmare from the beginning. Delta lost my baggage, sent me to the wrong gate (their own staff directions) from lost Angeles to Atlanta. Missed my contact because of this i spend the night at airport, with zero sleep, not even carry on case because they took it from me at gate without even asking. Missed s work meeting resulting in loss of money. Departure from Baltimore, they delayed my flight close to 3 hours and when landing in Detroit for layover to LAX of course it was missed. Delta sent me to San Diego at my request, they didnâ€™t offer any real solutions, other than an eternal â€œweâ€™re sorryâ€. Just avoid Delta all together. Not worth the few dollars you think might will be saving. They still havenâ€™t found my items."
319,2,18,May,2022,Economy Class,Denver , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta is a joke of an airline. I flew Delta for the first time today and it was my worst travel experience. Iâ€™ve flown so many airlines and none of these experiences have been bad enough that I felt I needed to write a review about it, other than Delta. I have never seen employees as rude as the ones at the Denver International Airport baggage claim and gate. I witnessed many different employees be beyond mean to customers for actually no reason. I definitely wonâ€™t be flying Delta again, and can guarantee a lot of people that were on my flight wonâ€™t be. Hire more qualified employees, those with customer service experience."
320,3,17,May,2022,Economy Class,Tampa , Syracuse , Atlanta      ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Awful experience. Flight bumped and caused me to stay another night in FL. Customer service said they would cover the hotel, just tell the gate agent. No one knew how to help and sent me to customer service again. Between 3 and 10 hour hold times. Twitter support and text support refuse to help and refuse to put me in for a callback. No way to reach anyone. I fly twice a month. This was my first try with Delta and my last! Additionally, in my flight that I was bumped to I was forced to the last row and isle service skipped me!"
321,1,16,May,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , They canceled our direct flight 20 minutes before departure. For rebooking we waited in line almost 3 hours. Now we lost 1 day and we have a flight with 1 stop with seats on the last row. When I asked about any support with this situation they answered very rudely and disrespectfully. No help at all! It is my first and last time with Delta. Terrible service!
322,1,16,May,2022,Economy Class,Detroit , Jacksonville        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  I was flying out of Detroit to Jacksonville on Sunday May 15th. I had a meeting Monday morning at 8am. Delta canceled my flight and changed it to Monday Morning at 6am out of Detroit. They informed me of this on May 14th at 4pm. I had to cancel my flight and change my meeting with my customer. Delta still charged me $150 to cancel my reservation that they made on my behalf. Without notice. Bottom Line: If you fly Delta - prepare to be screwed.
323,1,15,May,2022,Economy Class,San Francisco , New York City     ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," San Francisco to New York City. Arrived early, crew arrived late for scheduled take off, because of traffic. My family and I had the same traffic and managed arrived on time for our flight. Our reserved seat were changed (booked serval months ago) then several mechanical issues to include leaking fuel. After 3 delays we are still not in the plane. Itâ€™s currently 1:00 pm we scheduled to fly at 11:40. Worst service ever. Unacceptable crew delays and maintenance issue horrible"
324,1,14,May,2022,Economy Class,Denver , Boston        , Detroit      ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Absolutely awful airline. Overbooked our flight and essentially just kicked us off and gave away our seats. Then the lady laughed in our face when we asked if there was anything she could do to help us and blatantly lied right to our faces saying she did everything she could to get us on. I will never fly Delta again.
325,1,14,May,2022,First Class,Orlando , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  First flight, was supposed to depart at 1. Didnâ€™t leave the ground until 3:40ish. Was supposed to be a two hour flight, we didn't land until 7:40 and werenâ€™t allowed off the plane until 8. Our second flight was scheduled for 9:20 (after a delay thankfully). We thought because of the delay we would make the plane but it got pushed back to 12am and then cancelled. We were reschedule for a flight the next day but that got cancelled as well without any notification. Thankfully we were watching the app. We went to the flight rescheduling stand and they were pretty difficult to work with. We decided to try driving home but all the rental car were taken. We ended up having to take uhauls home instead. Will not be recommending Delta or for people to fly through JFK."
326,1,11,May,2022,Premium Economy,Panama City , New York      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Spain, Trip Verified ," Panama City to New York. Unremarkable in every possible way. No lounge access at PTY, no priority security, rude on the ground staff at PTY, old equipment with circa 1990s IFE. Simply can't imagine why anyone would actually pay for this (yes I did). This wasn't a first-class experience, not even a second class experience, very much a third class experience. Don't really understand why people think Delta is so great. As a OneWorld Elite, I won't be returning to Delta anytime soon."
327,1,11,May,2022,Economy Class,Paris , Dallas , Salt Lake City    ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Traveled to Paris in May 2022 was holding economy tickets till I got Delta premium select R via miles dirt cheap. DTW to CDG on the A350 the service was okay. At the start the Delta one person in charge came over and told us the crew for the area will take good care of us. Seemed a lie because when the service started it was the same crew for us as for economy class. The meals are served on a plastic purple plate in foil tins. Meals nothing great but tasted fine. Breakfast was served 1hr prior to landing in CDG. Not sure why Delta wouldn't carter a McDonalds original egg muffin with sausage as it is much better and probably cheaper. Not worth in Premium R to Europe nothing is different but getting Sky Priority, and headset and the amenity kit. Delta would have to add lounge access to make it worth while. It seems only the routes to Korea get good food in proper plates. plus service. On the return from CDG to SLC was on a A330-900 Neo. The food was horrid, and one cannot imagine why Delta would cater such food out of Paris. Considering they cater sandwiches for the snack available at anytime which were much better plus the hot cookie. Instead of complaining about Emirates and Qatar Airways focus on the food services and dedicated service in Premium R to compete with them. Premium R should have dedicated crew that is not working economy class and seats that recline more maybe to 175D. Till Delta fixes those issue then Premium R is a joke even if you get at dirt cheap miles."
328,1,11,May,2022,Economy Class,Denver , Pittsburgh        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This has been the most horrific experience I have ever had with an airline.

329,1,10,May,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Idaho Falls     ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  There's no accountability at all with airlines. They cancelled our flight to Idaho falls after some error with the plane, (it's a 45 minute flight). Then already filled the other planes going to Idaho falls on other airlines and the next one to leave isn't until 2:45. They gave us some tiny biscuits and waters but now I'm forced to go pay my life savings away for some terrible airport food. No compensation, no meals, no nothing. There should be something returned to the customer. It's completely ruining our trip and now I'm missing all my classes and day off work. All because we couldn't complete a tiny 45 minute flight."
330,1,9,May,2022,Premium Economy,New York , Santo Domingo      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Italy, Trip Verified ,"  Worst experience ever for the first time after travelling with many other companies. The flight was cancelled and the company did not notify us either the travel agency. Even after being at fault they made us wait for hours just to give us one only option, which made us lose an entire day of our honeymoon! Delta manager requested us to answer some questions, but when we asked him some questions he never replied, always giving us the same sentence. He said we had to speak with Delta and not with him, when he was the manager in charge of Delta. We were being ignored and they made fun of us from 11am until 2pm. I have never being treated so awfully in my life! They completely ruined our honeymoon."
331,5,8,May,2022,Economy Class,New York , Indianapolis       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified , New York to Indianapolis. This was literally the worst flying experience I have ever had in my life and Iâ€™ve been flying since I was two years old. First off they cancelled my flight without giving me any type of notification at all. I just arrived at the airport and the ticketing agent is the one who informed me as I was trying to check in. I also prepaid to check a bag that the ticketing counter told me Iâ€™d be better off not checking in because of all the changes they were having. So I paid $30 for a bag that didnâ€™t even get checked in. So I tried to see if there were any flights that would be arriving to Indy earlier because even though I work I am also a mother to 6 year old daughter who was expecting me to be home early afternoon who I would be disappointing immensely because of this to which I was informed that there were no flights and I would just have to endure the long day. After enduring the additional 8 hours at the airport itâ€™s finally time to check in and get on the plane. As Iâ€™m going through I am literally forced to check my bag in due to â€œlack of spaceâ€ on the flight. So the bag I spent $30 to check that I was told to not check because of all the changes Iâ€™m given no choice to check in. I was almost in tears at this time because I was expected in hours ago and it seems that regardless of what I want Delta and their employees plus care less. It is very evident that Delta doesnâ€™t give the slightest iota for the people who fly for them. I will literally never fly with this company again it was the only part of my entire trip and I regret using Delta rather than my normal airline. Lesson learned on Delta flights your just a number not human being.
332,1,7,May,2022,Economy Class,Las Vegas , Elmira       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I am 80 years old, I am able to walk, but have trouble walking long distances especially when I have to walk fast. I like flying with Delta because I like the airport in Elmira, which is 2 hours from home. My problem was coming back from Las Vegas. The plane left on time, no problem. When we got to Detroit, we were a little early, not much, but we were early. We were not able to get to our gate because something was parked in our way. It was announced that we had to wait for someone to move the vehicle before we could deplane. I was going to ask the stewardess for a seat closer to the front of the plan when I got on, because I only had about 45 minutes to get to my connecting flight to Elmira, NY. I noticed the plane was full so I didn't bother to ask. We waited approximately 10 minutes before the plane could get in its spot for passengers to deplane. According to my ticket I had approximately 45 minutes to get to my new gate for Elmira, NY. Now 10 more minutes had passed, so now I had 35 minutes to get there. Of course I was towards the back of the plan so that was about another 10 to 15 minutes. My daughter had requested a wheelchair assistance for me because I have trouble walking long distances. It was on my ticket for Service request: Wheelchair requested. When I finally got off the plane there was no wheelchair for me. There was another lady there in a wheelchair. I told the lady behind the desk I requested the wheelchair and she said just have a seat that one would be coming. I told her that I had to catch another flight in about 20 minutes and she asked me what time the flight was. I told her and she said "" Oh they are probably gone by now."" I asked her if she could call the gate that I was suppose to go to and she said just have a seat. I was anxious and I said I need to get to my gate. She said to me "" Don't yell at me"". I said I wasn't yelling and that I was concerned about making my flight. About that time a young attendant showed up with a wheelchair but he was assigned to another lady. I said could you please take me to my gate so that I don't miss my flight. He said he was only assigned to the other lady. He saw that I was upset and he said "" OK I will take you too. She we left gate A72 or gate A76 ( I am not sure) and my new gate was B2. When we got down to the tunnel for B he told his supervisor that I had to make a connecting flight to B2 and then the supervisor said it was okay for him to take me. This young boy was a little miracle for me and when we got to Gate B2 the plane was already loaded and I don't know if anyone called them to say that I was coming or not, but they greeting me very friendly. I got to my seat and minutes later we were in the air. I will fly again with Delta, but I feel there should be more time between connecting flights because of the distance between gates, especially if person has to get to a distant gate from where they landed. I still have my tickets if the Airline wants to contact me to verify what I have stated."
333,1,5,May,2022,Premium Economy,Las Vegas , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Unfortunately Delta customer service is not helpful at all. I changed my flight to another time and requested seats. The person over the phone told me we have seats 21 A and B. When I arrived to the airport there was no seats assigned. Nobody at the airport cared or took responsibility.
334,1,4,May,2022,Economy Class,New York , Salt Lake City     ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Horrible experience. Had us on the plane for three hours, then returned to the gate we were told we would be put on a new plane. Sent us to a new gate, and after 20 to 30 minutes the agent came out and said that the flight was cancelled until tomorrow morning at 8 am. Agents were rude and not really helpful."
335,1,2,May,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Memphis        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Flight was cancelled because Delta didn't schedule a pilot to fly the airplane. Flight was rescheduled 10 hours after original flight. For spending the night in an airport and taking 10 hours of my time for a management foul up, Delta wants to offer me a $75 dollar flight voucher. $75 for 10 hours! That's not even minimum wage. What an insult. I have flown other airlines in the past. There are going to be problems from time to time, but the other airlines knew how to better apologize for their mistakes. I'll use them from now on"
336,7,29,April,2022,Economy Class,Chattanooga , Wichita , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Chattanooga to Wichita via Atlanta. Donâ€™t book with Delta if you have an option. I wish I had an option and they werenâ€™t the only airline that flies out of my town. Their â€œcheapâ€ tickets are not cheap. You still pay $200- 300 plus on average for one way, you donâ€™t get mile points for the basic economy, you canâ€™t change flights, oh you also have to pay $99 to just cancel the flight, and no refundable. Wonâ€™t even give an e-credit to your account. Nearly, every time I fly with them they overbook the plane and people have to be asked to fly another time or day, Iâ€™m so over it. I hate how many scam and fraud airlines there are."
337,1,29,April,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Puerto Vallarta     ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked a trip through Delta Vacations for my 16-year-old daughter and me, for spring break. We boarded the plane with excitement! It was an all-around horrific experience. The flight attendants were rude. The tv screen did not work. The drink I ordered was not available. This is all minor, compared to the supposedly 4 + star resort that we arrived at. It was more like a 1-star resort. Very outdated. Very rude staff. The amenities were mediocre. The food was awful, we both got sick! We could not even go to the beach, there were so many horses and horse manure, it smelled awful! Delta basically laughed at me and said they were 3 months from returning emails. I called and told them my concerns! They offered me $100 credit, per person. I paid over $4000 for this vacation. It was a horrible experience. I am just glad we made it out of there alive. I have never been more thankful to get back from a vacation. It was a terrible experience all around. I will never fly Delta again."
338,1,29,April,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Las Vegas     ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Canada, Trip Verified ,"  Due to the incompetence of the pilot not making it to his scheduled flight on DL2809 our vacation has been delayed. The lady at the flight kiosk had mentioned that the Pilot was not going to make it for his scheduled flight and that this would be affecting our vacation plans. The incompetence is unacceptable and the customers are the ones to deal with the consequences. Nothing but a ""sorry"" from the ""sorry staff""."
339,2,29,April,2022,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , Minneapolis       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Iâ€™ve flown with specifically Delta for 3+ years because they are simply the best or so I thought. My father recently passed away and I was left with choice of flying across the country. If I had known just how much this company does not care about itâ€™s customers I would not have flown with Delta. I was the next of kin and without being in the same state as the incident I needed to be there before I could provide information like the funeral home so I could receive the bereavement fare. I could not provide such information so in return I had to pay $320 for a flight. Itâ€™s absolutely disgusting the way customer service has treated me in regard to reaching out about help with the flight. They had the audacity to ask me to pay for a new flight instead. This is disgusting behavior.

We enjoyed free movies and TV shows as well as complimentary snacks. They also had free baggage check-in! 5 star customer service. I will only fly Delta from now on, they know how to treat there passengers."
341,1,26,April,2022,Economy Class,Provo , New York       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This was the most horrible experience I ever had in air travel in my life. I have been a Delta Skymiles member for many years and I will never fly with them again. First they cancelled the connecting flight from Atlanta to Provo because they didnâ€™t have a pilot. I had to change my whole itinerary to leave the next day and arrive back a day later. Not to mention needing another covid test and travel clearance again to fly to my destination. On the way back to JFK, apparently they never cancelled my return flight from the previous day to the following day and I had to wait for over an hour for a Delta representative to even pick up a phone and correct this mistake. The women who was handling my problem was very rude and seemed bored by the whole problem. As I said earlier, I will never fly Delta again."

There were 12 of us in our party flying out for my brother's funeral. Our flight was initially delayed due to plane not being available so they pulled a plane had just completed the annual maintenance. We were delayed again due to de-icing and needing to wait for winds to die down so they could use the lift to de-ice. In the air, they announced we would be delayed due to need to land to re-fuel. On the ground in Great Falls. ID we waited for gas until they announced we had issue with crew timing out so we would need to stay overnight. We waited in line for well over a hour to find out we needed to eat on site to use food voucher. We waited 1.5 hrs for shuttle to hotel and when we arrived the hotel did not have any rooms (thankfully Hilton put us up at another Hilton property). We arrived back at the airport the next morning (6am) as instructed and waited around until they announce our plane (just out of annual service) had issue with hydraulics so we needed to wait for part and for someone who could fix. We than were told we had to wait as the plane was low on hydraulic fluid and the truck had to go and get some more. We boarded and finally arrived at our destination 23 hrs later. For all of this Delta gave us $75 voucher - no words for how crazy that is. I requested a voucher for the cost of our tickets but waiting to hear back."

We werenâ€™t able to include our middle name online for some reasons and werenâ€™t able to input our passports info as well. We were very concerned about not being able to board since our names on reservation are not matching with our passports. We made one call after hour and was told by representative itâ€™ll take 1-2 days to wait for email confirmation. We thought it was taken care of but nothing has been done after a few days. Follow up with a chat representative she was very nice and helpful but referred us to ticketing support instead. We called back regular hour spoke to Louis he was our angel and a savior. He teamed up with back office and made the correction and emailed the confirmation to us all 8 of us while I was on the phone with him. Thank you Louis and your team for all your hard work, effort, and efficient customer service.  You made Delta look good and great again."
344,10,24,April,2022,Economy Class,Denver , Barcelona , New York     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Denver to Barcelona via New York. Delta has a series of automated systems and policies that leads the consumer to be screwed out of the seats they spend time and money to select. My fiance/hubby and I flew to Europe for our Weddingmoon, meticulously planning our travel to avoid issues. Only to find, on our 19 hr travel days, that our seats had been changed on both the departure and return flights - this gave me a migraine on the way there and separated us on the way home. No one on their staff can ever help solve problems so you pay extra to have them do whatever their system wants, while ""tying"" the hands of their employees. Not to mention the horribly uncomfortable seats and unhappy flight attendants. Received nothing but unhelpfulness, and so we will never fly with Delta again. Giving my money to better businesses."

We were put on the next flight out April 2 at 7:10 am. That flight was delayed and we were put on a other flight at 10am. The pilot didn't show up for that flight so we were put on as ""standby"" customers at 1pm. No luck with the 1pm flight so we got put on the 3 pm flight because I think someone in the boarding area felt bad for me because my kids were so upset and complaining to me. I am here to say I will never fly Delta again!"

We are both skymiles medallion members and fly Delta whenever possible. I ran into a few Delta flight attendants at a Charleston hotel â€” they were standing to the side of the check in stand, so I thought they were waiting on their room to be ready. The front desk lady waived me over, so I headed up to check in. After I checked in, the delta flight attendants rudely proclaimed â€œwe were actually waiting before herâ€. I felt bad and apologized and explained I thought they were just waiting to the side. Instead of just letting it go, they rudely rolled their eyes. I was very disappointed in their attitudes, especially in uniform! Makes me rethink our loyalty to delta."
348,1,22,April,2022,Economy Class,Albany , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We have tickets to go to Bermuda on Delta and I wanted to change the return flight. You cannot reach a human being by phone to request a flight change or anything else for that matter. The online chat is not with a human but is an automated and completely nonresponsive auto messaging system. When the system said it would connect me to a human, I am still waiting after 15 minutes. No telling when if ever a real person will actually chat with me. In short, Delta seems happy with booking people on flights but is unwilling or unable to provide any degree of customer support. Airlines as poorly run as this should go out of business."
349,1,21,April,2022,First Class,Seattle , Kona        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I would like to say Delta was always my airline of choice. They have great customer service. Mostly because of Covid I planned my trip by train the rides (round trip) were canceled do to Covid and related personnel issues. So, the price was much higher for this round trip to Florida than anticipated. It was a little tricky to get Delta for every flight. We all hear the news about mask wearing. There are two sides to every story as they say. I have always followed the rules. So, of course I wore my mask with some discomfort. Most people complied with this law for mass transit. I did notice many airline personnel without masks. I am one to mind my own business; but I believe you lead through example. My main problem with flying anymore is the long lines-hurry up and wait. I do have metal implants that can set off security alarm systems at courthouses and airport. I also mention this. So, of course I had to be patted down. i do not like this procedure, but wanting to complete my travel plans i complied. I carry prescriptions that can easily show up on x ray, but most of the pills I carry are holistic supplements. I am sure that my ""misplaced"" luggage was no accident. This has happened to friends in the past and to my husband several years ago( Delta for sure). So, it is my belief airlines are too interested in our personal belongings. Anytime a bag was lost or delayed that said luggage contained medicine, both prescription and holistic. Air travel is very expensive and keeps going up. The inconvenience was just too much during this last trip. In my opinion Delta has higher standards than the other airlines. If i have to travel by air again I know I will choose them. Upon arrival back into Albany in March we took an awful bump upon landing. The flight was from LaGuardia to Albany around five in the afternoon. I have flown often in the past and many international flights. That was the worst landing I ever experienced.  If Delta or any airlines wants to keep customers flying they have much work to do. Thank you for reading this."

On the plus side we had a delicious meal, enjoyed great entertainment, and had warm efficient service. So much better than in the recent past when a box of cold food was served by a haughty attendant. In this world of low expectations Delta has stepped back up, a bit."
351,2,19,April,2022,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Iâ€™ve never been treated like less than a human being more than when speaking to Delta employees. I was trapped in Panama, after arriving to the airport 3 hours early to my flight. They refused to let me check my bag, which I was fine with, I was even about to throw out the whole bag. After saying this they then proceeded to tell me I cannot board my flight, and could not give me a legitimate reason as to why. The exact words I was told was â€œoh well you should've got here earlier. She told me she could book me a new flight for the next day and said the price would be $400 when online the same exact flight was $144. She then handed me a piece of paper with a help number to call which I couldnâ€™t call because I do not have international calls on my phone plan and refused to let me use a phone. When I asked for a supervisor or manager she brought me 4 different guys that were not a supervisor or manager and lied saying they were. I had to pay another cab back to my hotel and also pay for another night there. Finally back in America, Iâ€™ve been calling everyday Delta customer service to speak to a representative and on hold 5 hours for the past 4 days which every time I get to 5 hours it just magically disconnects. Finally I got through to someone, she was the sweetest person who works at Delta, and shortly after being connected we were disconnected. I tried calling one more time today, and after 5 hours and 45 mins I was connected with someone, I explained to her the situation and this lady now that I was speaking to was even worse than the workers at Panama Airport. Overall Delta needs to reevaluate their staff, this is so completely unacceptable. I was not refunded nor credited, nor even tried to make accommodation for the cab and extra hotel night I had to pay. This is such disgusting behavior, and I will not be returning to Delta ever again. I hope anyone considering Delta completely goes straight to Jetblue where they value and care about their customers and always make the moment right."
352,1,18,April,2022,Economy Class,Sydney , Atlanta        , Los Angeles     ,Solo Leisure,Australia, Trip Verified ,"  I never write reviews but how Delta treats its customers deserves one. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Atlanta in Premium Select although unfortunately I got Covid a day prior to my flight. I called customer service to explain to them the situation. Instead of sympathising or providing me alternatives they gave me a $2000 option to reschedule my flights by a week, this is after already having paid $4000 for the initial flights. I would have rather spoken to the Robot option as I am sure the robot would have been more empathetic. Instead I was able to use e-credits to book myself a week later in Basic Economy. I paid almost twice the money to get 1/2 the service, well done Delta! I wish there was an option of negative infinity to rate their customer service."

My husband got moved to first class and I am left sitting in the back next to a stranger. My husband is a part of your top tier and I am gold status. This is a constant problem with Delta. Cheaper airlines can figure it out but not Delta. Not sure what, exactly, we are overpaying for."

This is the way way they treat business customers? Totally unacceptable. Then they give me a $15 meal card which basically tells me Iâ€™m worth $5/ hour cause I have to wait an additional 3 hours in addition to the already earlier 3 hours for original flight. I thought Spirt was the worst, Deltas runs neck n neck. Now I miss my meeting I was supposed to make, do they care. No, letâ€™s see deltas CEO get his flights canceled and have to wait an additional 3 hours, you can bet if they had to compensate everyone inconvenienced on that flight with a free flight another plane would be ready in less then an hour to take off. But they already got your money so they don't care."

358,1,11,April,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Miami        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," Atlanta to Miami. Had to change the flight date, to the next date. They decided to put in the main cabin and give me a E-credit which you are not able to see or use, but I tried. So, wonder how many people have they done this to. Is it possible that they are committing some type of fraud to there passengers and keeping the credit? The attorney general shouldâ€™ve investigated this. Anyways, absolutely horrible service. After waiting online and texting back-and-forth for five hours they never resolved the issue of putting me back to first class. Unfortunately, once the customer service rep and understand what needs to be done they rather send you to the next customer service representative, this goes on until you give up."
359,1,10,April,2022,Premium Economy,Atlanta , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,  Horrible customer service. I was rebooked when my flight got cancelled. I was on the phone for two hours and no one answered so I went onto the website. I was talking to an agent through chat he had rebooked me then he charged me 300.00 for the flight difference. Once I get to back to the airport for my new flight they tell me my payment was not on the system. I tried to show the staff my receipt and the messages that I was going through the airlines website. After they told me to call them. At this point I was done calling no one answered I had tried to reach them all morning. I had been at the airport in Atlanta (which is 2 hours away from my home) all day. I walked away and the staff member yelled â€œwalking away wonâ€™t fix your problemâ€ I was very frustrated with everything going on. I needed to be in LA but the next day once. The staff yelled you forgot your ID and once he saw I was in tears he called someone to see what was going on with my ticket. I felt humiliated by a staff that did not want to help. They charged me an additional 300 to get one the plane. I honestly will never fly with a them

We traveled from New York to Sydney this week and overall a good enough experience but I wonâ€™t be flying again on long hauls with Delta. In my opinion, they werenâ€™t very flexible with understanding when customers fell asleep and their mask fell down a bit. It happened to us, and many others I witnessed. They would wake you up from asleep and tell you to fix your mask. A little more situational awareness wouldnâ€™t have gone astray."
361,1,8,April,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Phoenix      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  This is the third flight in a row that was either delayed or cancelled. This time it had some pretty expensive impacts. We arrived at the airport and found out 20 mins before boarding the flight was cancelled. We had an Air BNB (non-refundable) set up a Turo rental (non-refundable) and tee time for golf booked (non-refundable). We are out quite a bit of money that we would like to get reimbursed for or compensated in kind. I understand that there are times ""act of god"" where weather is an issue or things out of Delta's control happen. This is not the case as we were told that they didn't have a pilot. This just sounds like bad planning and we shouldn't be victim's of that kind of issue. The average wait time to talk to anyone is 3+ hours which really is ridiculous."

I was supposed to leave Des Moines at 7:30am on a direct flight that would get in at 11:00am. They just canceled my flight at 11:00pm the night before. They rebooked my flight and now I will not be getting into New York until 5:00pm. So I will be missing the rehearsal dinner. Tried calling at 11:00 pm when I saw my flight was canceled and rebooked. There is a 2 hr and 50 min wait time to reach customer service. I am done with Delta. They are a terrible airline.

365,4,6,April,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Austin        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Let me just start by saying, riding with Delta this past Sunday was a major inconvenience. On April 3rd I arrived at the airport around 4am to catch my 6.45am flight that would later connect to another flight in ATL. My first flight of that day went smoothly, and I took note as to how the different groups of passengers were being called as to not overcrowd the area. As I had previously flown into CHI using a connecting flight, I had plans to be back in Austin by 12pm so that I could make it to work later that day. When I arrived in ATL, I walked over to station B28 as to be ready to board the plane. I arrived early and I paid close attention as the passengers were called to board the plane, however the screen never changed from saying â€œPRORITYâ€. As the announcer called passengers, she announced 1st class, main cabin 1, main cabin 2 and main cabin 3 but to my confusion she never announced BASIC. As time neared for my flight to leave, my roommate and I walked over to the station to ask when they would announce for â€œBASICâ€ to board the plane. I watched as a woman and her daughter were helped to board the plane and I stepped up to be boarded right after her. The lady spoke with me and said â€œIâ€™ll be right backâ€ before closing the door to the plane in front of me and a group containing at least 5 other passengers. The conversation that commenced after her return was very sad when referring to customer service. Not only was she rude to me as a passenger but she seemingly taunted the fact that my flight left without me on board. As she faced me, there was a lady in a red suit to her left who also claimed she wanted to help but offered a 4.40pm flight as a substitute for my 10am flight, omitting the fact that there was a 12.30am flight that she had access to add us to as standby passengers. Both ladies are a poor excuse for employees at a company that is supposed to pride themselves in customer service. Taking the conversation from 0 to 100, I believe it took more effort to be rude then it did to just help us and apologize for the inconvenience. They argued the fact, saying that I was not at the door when I clearly contacted her before she turned her back on me. Not only were the two ladies rude but they seemingly meant harm in their demeanor, and they wanted my flight to leave me behind. As a customer, I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again because if I paid for a flight, I should be able to ride on my flight without complications and poor attitudes from staff. I feel these two ladies were upset with the fact that passengers were slow to accept checking their luggage and they decided to take out their frustrations on the passengers. After getting help at the main Delta help desk, I felt like the employee wanted to be helpful, but the conversation could only be what I feel was â€œhe said she said.â€ As the lady could do nothing to help me further with submitting a complaint about my previous interaction with the staff at B28 at 10am. The rude behavior from your Delta employees persisted and even as I was placed on standby flight for 12:31am I was still not properly confirmed on my flight. I went to the desk of station B5 and when I asked if he could explain what â€œstandbyâ€ meant he rudely told me â€œLook at the screenâ€ as he continued his conversation with a coworker. Maybe all the employees that work with Delta in ATL specifically are just used to being rude, but that's not fair to customers"

However when he asked about a meal and hotel as stated on their website for delays over 3 hours. He was told sorry we donâ€™t do that. And we donâ€™t accommodate for mechanical issues. He slept in the airport. And they overbooked the next flight. They tried to offer him a payment of $1000 to give up his seat! Really you canceled his flight then want him to give up his seat! He said no thank you. Why do they not follow their own procedures and why do they get away with it? We will never fly Delta again.

I booked a seat for me and my son. We were seated across the isle from a mom and three small kids. First the smallest child was never in a seatbelt he was bouncing on his mom's lab. The smallest child had a toy truck and threw it missing me by inches. The other two had games which they played without ear phones. The smallest kept running up and down the aisle. This went on for the duration of my flight. The staff tried their best to keep them calm and they apologized repeatedly.

I would just like to Delta Special Services at JAX was the most compassionate, empathetic, helpful airline employee I have ever met. Delta delayed our flight from JAX to ATL. As a result, my wife and I knew we would miss our connecting flight from ATL to IAH. Staff went above and beyond normal Delta Special Services standards to search for alternative flights and eventually get us moved to the top of a standby list in ATL. Only 3 of the 23 people on the standby list made it onto the flight. My wife and I were #1 and #2. Thank you so much!"
370,1,4,April,2022,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta. My flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta yesterday was delayed 50 minutes due to to purported ""baggage loading"" issues. Actually, the problem was caused by not having enough Delta baggage employees to service the number of flights out of this airport. Initially, the pilot said it would be a delay of 5 minutes, which became 15 minutes, which became 30 minutes, which became 50 minutes. This caused me to miss the connection in Atlanta. NO DELTA staff attempted to assist passengers with extremely tight connections in deplaning. Nobody from Delta met the plane. I was informed I would be rebooked on another flight in TWO DAYS. Delta employees were rude, unhelpful, and dismissive. Obviously, treating passengers this way is a daily occurrence for them."
371,1,4,April,2022,Economy Class,Tampa , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This has been by far my worst flying experience. My original flight was deplaned after sitting inside for 3 hours due to weather (which is understandable). What upset me our gate was abandoned by the staff and no explanation was given while the board only displayed a flight delay. After asking other delta gates I was told ""we can't help you with that"". I then waited another 3 hours just to get my luggage back. After all of this they were not able to offer me another flight for an additional 5 days leaving me stranded on my trip. I had to spend over $1000 in additional hotel, parking, and living expense on top of loss of wages from my job. I reached out to customer support and they offered me a 50% refund on my $180 round trip flight. They told me the best way to get home would be to purchase a $200 one way ticket. Customer support left me on hold for 6 hours and was very rude."

A gentleman mentioned to try Delta. Delta told my husband at counter that they only gave out to Delta passengers. When I got to counter, Delta told me they were out. All within a 30 second time frame. I have no tolerance for stingy greedy people. Yea it was our fault we misplaced the mask but that is just no way to operate a business. So not only are they liars they are stingy and greedy."

I am very disappointed with the staff's treatment here at Delta, especially at the Atlanta Hub. I had an employee yell at me! Tell me that my concerns for my luggage were not her problem. I was delayed for my first flight and conned into buying a â€œfirst-class ticketsâ€ (X 2) 200 dollar upgrade - then yelled at again for asking why I had not boarded and to find out that there was no upgrade. So here I am on the aircraft, wondering what I paid for after a 6-hour delay. The way the lady yelled at me was dehumanizing. I will never fly Delta again. Iâ€™m sick to my stomach. Oh, and I paid for your wifi pass that never worked or connected."

Waited in line at check-in counter for 1.5 hours and missed flight. Rebooked for later flight but my son did not have a seat on our connecting flight, even though it was part of our original flight plan. We barely made it on time. My disabled child and I were seated in different parts of plane. Flight crew would not assist in seating us together. Many open seats. Said we would need to de-board and find a different flight. I found someone who volunteered to change seats. In Atlanta, gate agents were very rude with total lack of customer service. Worst airline experience by far."

Crew were good, cabin and seats were good. Free wifi messaging is great, flight pass was too expensive. First class food was a choice of one of three cold boxed meals. Special meals were unable to be requested on this route. Personally do not like the Delta website or app, looks very cluttered and outdated compared to the other major US airlines."

381,2,30,March,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Charlotte        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My wallet fell out of my purse on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Charlotte. I went to back to the airport and checked with lost and found etc but it had not been turned in. Thankfully a flight attendant called me and told me she found my wallet on the plane but she was now in Detroit with it. She was trying to figure out a way to get it on a returning flight to Charlotte that day, with another flight attendant or she was going to bring it herself in two days on a returning flight. It seemed it would all work out and then the Gate manager got involved and confiscated it from the flight attendant. The gate manager promised the flight attendant that they would call me ASAP but no one called. (Still no call three days later). I called the Detroit Delta Lost and Found, the next morning, and spoke to an agent and explained that the wallet was located and positively handed off to the Manager of all the Delta gates at A27 on March 27th. The gate manager is aware of who I am and my wallet. The woman on the phone said to me that they had not retrieved any of the found items from the gates and it wasnt really a priority! I exclaimed that I was stranded in Charlotte until I could get my wallet back. I begged her to take my phone number and She rudely told me to fill out an online report. That was it! I did as she asked and waited all day. Its now three days later and I am still waiting. I had to cancel my flight. I'm missing work and I have no money or ID. I cant believe how unhelpful Delta has been. I will never fly again with this airline. I should mention that the first blow was that on my 5.5 hour red eye flight from SFO to Atlanta we were not offered anything to drink. Not even water. when I asked the flight attendant, he was very rude and returned with a half full plastic cup of water. I was extremely dehydrated the entire flight. Delta is terrible. The only highlight of this story is the nice flight attendant who went out of her way to help me, until her employer destroyed all progress."

I had a round trip from Delta airlines and the Delta employees messed up with my boarding pass at the gate, eventually leading me being noted down as a ""no-show"" for the first part of the flight - and of course I ""was"" on that flight. Then they cancelled my return ticket. It turns out that not only I am considered as a no-show for a journey that I made, they don't even let the customer know once they cancel a ticket. So they cancelled my return ticket and I only discovered about it a few hours before my return flight. On top of my distress (I was trying to figure out a way to go back home, there were no other available flights until the next day) the person at the desk was super rude saying ""it was my fault"": I showed up at their gate with the correct boarding pass and they messed things up afterwards, with multiple employees involved in the process and I am the person to be blamed here? Spent ridiculously long hours on their customer help lines just to reach a single person to talk to (6 hours for a single call) and ended up with literal ""nothing"" other than a wasted ticket, money spent on an overly-priced flight to get back home, hours and hours of distress and unkind behavior from their part, all on top of their own mistake."

384,1,29,March,2022,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Pittsburgh , Detroit     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Our flight departed at 5.39am, so we showed up 2 hours prior to departure. The ticket desk wasn't open, so we were stuck in the lobby with dozens of other passengers for over an hour. This caused a massive crowd and lots of confusion going thru airport security. As if that wasn't bad enough, for whatever reason despite my husband and I being ticketed on the same confirmation, we weren't assigned seats next to each other. When he made the reservations, he made sure to request a window seat for me but somehow Delta assigned us to middle seats on the opposite side of the aisle. He spent over 2 hours on hold on Saturday trying to get our seats reassigned so we would be next to each other, only for the customer service agent to tell him that we would need to speak to the agent at the desk to get reassigned. My husband tried to ask, but couldn't even finish asking his question because the agent cut him off and rudely announced over the intercom that there would be no seat reassignments. He asked the flight crew as we boarded, only to be met with blank stares and headshakes. They were unwilling to move other passengers to keep us together. We were now at the mercy of our fellow passengers, none of which were willing to switch seats to keep us together. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re wondering why this is important. Iâ€™ve flown frequently, and have noticed that sitting in the middle causes me to have anxiety, motion sickness, and feelings of claustrophobia. And this was all exaggerated by having to wear a mask for a prolonged period of time. My only chance for comfort on this flight, was having my husband by my side, and being switched to a window or aisle seat. I almost immediately had the worst panic attack of my life. Full out crying and shaking. The flight crew walked up and down the aisles past me, not caring that they played a part in my suffering by not moving other passengers to keep me with my husband. And my husband was unable to comfort me, being stuck across the aisle and between two strangers, so this flight was rough on him too. Finally, when one of the flight attendants did ask me what was wrong (while pushing the drink cart up the aisle) I told him, thru my tears, that I needed my husband. He asked me where my husband was, and I told him, but he did nothing to correct my situation. My panic attack lasted the duration of the flight.  I couldnâ€™t get off the plane fast enough. I was so shaken that I didnâ€™t want to get on our connecting flight.  All in all, your team had several opportunities to correct the situation, and dropped the ball repeatedly. Completely disappointed. Iâ€™ve always had a high opinion of Delta until now. Iâ€™ll probably never fly Delta again, based solely on this experience."

But this has ruined my vacation. We drive to the airport to get notified our flight is delayed, then 30 min later we hear another flight is delayed. I call customer service to see if itâ€™s going to get cancelled to get on a new flight and they reassure me itâ€™s not. We get to the airport and our flight gets canceled and we are rebooked for the next day. Not being from Cancun we obviously have to buy a taxi, a hotel, and food for the night. We also donâ€™t get to make money (me and my partner) tomorrow because we are now flying. I didnâ€™t receive a flight voucher and when I called about getting one the customer service woman was honestly a witch. She was extremely condescending, told me itâ€™s not Deltas fault and that I would have to eat the costs, well itâ€™s not my fault the flight was delayed either. She started verbally yelling at me and itâ€™s pretty appalling since I fly so much with Delta and just want my stay covered. Iâ€™m very upset and honesty wish I got her name because it has been the worst end to a vacation. Will never be flying with Delta internationally again"

When I tried checking in an hour later, my connecting flight had been delayed two hours â€” meaning I would be stranded in Detroit (and I wasnâ€™t going to sleep overnight in an airport). The customer service agent in Hartford was apologetic, waived the bag fee for my luggage and helped rebook me for Monday (meaning I would be stranded in CT for one more day). The following morning was better and both flights were uneventful and on time. The trip insurance covered my extra hotel stay and two weeks later, Delta customer service refunded over half of my ticket and sent me a $200 flight voucher. It pays to be polite and composed to customer service, theyâ€™re more likely to help you out than if youâ€™re screaming at them."

Now an adult, I can safely say Delta is just the worst. Case in point my latest trip - a roundtrip LHR-ATL. Desk service at LHR was terrible. Now I'm trying to move my return journey back a few days due to Covid, and it's impossible to make this simple change online. I had to call and wait for 2 hours to speak to an actual human, who then passed me on to several other people. Finally, I was told I would need to pay the fare difference of $865 for a Basic Economy seat. Literally the same flight, just a few days later - now costs nearly the same as the original roundtrip ticket ($1100). Such a joke."
391,3,26,March,2022,Economy Class,Daytona Beach , Newark , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Frankly, it is not worth the effort to review Delta's disgusting, disgraceful phone and messaging system. I have complained before, but Delta has been unresponsive to a horrible problem. During the height of the pandemic, customers were put on hold for up to 20 hours (20 hours!). Now it is down to anywhere from two to five hours. Delta requires human contact for many minor details (such as bringing a dog). But contacting a human at Delta is virtually impossible. And they are generally rude and unhelpful after I spend hours trying to make contact. I have been cut off several times after being connected. The virtual assistants are terrible, too. How can a computer be so stupid? It has been programmed into it. The virtual assistants keep repeating the same information and questions and do not understand what is input by voice or typed. I once loved flying Delta. But the effort has gotten so onerous I have switched to other airlines whenever possible. Those other airlines answer their phones without hours of holds. Delta just does not care."
392,8,25,March,2022,Economy Class,New York , Houston       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," I am very unhappy. My plane was set to leave at 7.20pm then only 5 hours prior to the flight the plane was delayed and moved to 10.10pm and then they changed it to 8.40pm takeoff and then after boarding 30 minutes later then the boarding time of 8.0pm we are sitting on the plane for over two and a half hours on the runway. They say weâ€™re about to take off and then we are just waiting around for two hours on the plane completely claustrophobic, not COVID friendly whatsoever and all they tell us is that they have to wait to switch directions. After they said they were able to get an alternative route they say the plane doesnâ€™t have enough fuel to do the alternative route and say we have to go back to the gate. Then we are told that the plane isnâ€™t allowed to take off and that we are 'fortunate' to have a gate to come back to because some planes have to just sit and wait on the runway when their is no available gates. My question is, if you originally had the flight at 7.20 departure and then delayed it to 10.10 why would you then undelay it and then only move it to 8.40? Because weâ€™ve been on the plane for more than the second delay time of 10.10. I am extremely disappointed. This was my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last! I have flown on 100+ legs, over 10 different countries and I have never experienced an issue like this before. At least on my other airplane experience they kept us informed. Delta is not transparent and clearly is aware of the situation so why move the delay down just to have everyone sit on the plane for 4 hours past the original departure time? This is the time that I should be arriving at my destination. And the only thing they tell us is â€œsorryâ€ and then offer our headphones to people and say â€œthese are normally $2 but weâ€™re giving them away because of the delayâ€. Two dollar headphones treating it like they are doing us a huge favor, they should at the very least give us food. I am blown away and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the company. Then they kick everyone off the plane after sitting in it for hours and tell us the staff needs to go home because theyâ€™ve been overworked and canâ€™t go over their hours and that we need to just wait to see what will happen and when they will get new staff and they kept reiterating that the flight was not going to be cancelled only delayed, and then boom after waiting from 5.45pm to 12.45am (7 hours) I find out that our 1.42am (delayed 5 times) is now cancelled. They told me the next flight at 6am is fully booked and then next flight will arrive around at 6pm on Friday. I am missing an entire day in my destination zone and my original flight I had picked specifically based off the time to make sure I would not be missing any work and now I am missing an entire day worth of work and whoâ€™s going to reimburse me for that? And also let my job know? I think after waiting 7 hours for a flight where the staff decided to disappear and sitting inside an airport breathing in the air of other people who could potentially have COVID during this pandemic. Completely unacceptable whatsoever. Delta can state that the plane was cancelled due to weather but I donâ€™t agree with that, they are using that as an excuse so that they are no liable for my flight and all the people who had to sit around for 7 hours waiting with full hope for a flight that got cancelled when the crew left. I deserve to be compensated."

January 2022 they pulled 12-14 people (who just went they TSA and had nothing bad in their luggage) aside, to go thru their stuff, taking so long that the pilot went over their flight-hours, forcing 200+ people to deboard and stay another night to catch the next plane at 5 pm. Never reimbursed us after they promised to. Today, March 23 2022, we made the mistake of flying Delta again. They didnâ€™t checked if the plane worked until boarding 200+ passengers, only then did they realize the snow censors werenâ€™t working. Instead of immediately boarding us on a plane that works, they had their maintenance man â€œtry to fix itâ€ for 3 hours, then deboarded 200+ passengers and causing us and many others to miss the connecting flight. Not a single Delta employee prioritized their customers. They told us theyâ€™d call the gate to have them hold the plane since it was Deltaâ€™s fault, got to the gate and they said they never called, so they took off without us."

Original itinerary stated our landing time in Atlanta was 9pm, we ended up arriving in Atlanta at 2am. And the cherry of the cake: they lost our bags, wasted an hour and a half waiting on the belts for the bags, never showed up, they were still in Madison, then another hour making a line trying to talk to Delta personnel. We got home at 4.30am that day. Our bags were shipped to our house and arrived at 3am Monday morning.

They gave us no call or text or email and no number to call them in DFW. I have been a multi-million miler for almost 30 years. I don't fly much now but there is no customer service in Delta any more. Absolutely no one to actually talk to. Even with this matter, they simply said it is a 3rd party delivery company and basically washed their hands of us. Update. The bags just arrived. They were delivered by someone who is actually in the pool service business. He had no idea of the history of the bags he was just an occasional driver when his other business is slow.

We asked the person at the desk if we could be looked after before the international travelers so we could catch the next flight to LA, leaving in 2 and half hour time. We were flatly refused and sent to the end of the queue. Surely we missed the next flight, after standing in a queue for more than 2 hours. The next available flight was next morning at 10.30 am. By right we should have been provided with accommodation, but no, we had to spend the night at the airport (my wife and I are 70 years old). They gave us a 60$ food voucher for two.

Leaving our home at 1am to make it to the airport in St Louis early for the flight, my mom was greeted with a 1.5 hr wait at the bag check and ticket desk. She didn't even make it to security. Once they finally addressed the 50+ people waiting in line, it was to tell them all that after their hour and a half wait the plane(s) had left without them. They stranded 50+ people at the airport. And when they told my mom the lady at the counter scoffed at her as if it had been her fault! I spent 7 hrs on the road this morning having to go back to pick her up after their failure. After contacting the chat online I was transferred to two different agents who told me three different stories. Ultimately I was told I have to call in not use chat (after 2 hrs of chatting) and call in to receive a 4 hr wait time on hold! Still on hold. So here's one for you Delta Air Lines, today because of your horrific customer service: My mother was disrespected in public by your rude employee. I lost $75 worth of gas I lost $625 of potential income for the time I spent having to travel to and from unnecessarily due to your failure I put just short of 500 miles on my car. My mother will not get to go see her first grandchild until we receive your ""possible"" refund in at the earliest 7 business days, too bad this week was the only time available in our family's schedule. So here's to you Delta. We will never fly with you again and will be sharing our story far and wide. You can bet on it! Update: 4 hrs on hold and they closed for the night without answering my call. Update: after holding another hour and a half this morning to Delta. We found out the lady at the airport didn't refund the ticket! Also they will not make this right and said compensation is not due to us."

Everyone was seated and did not leave the plane until the mechanics could be fixed, which allowed us to finally take off at 8.45am. The plane could have been more thoroughly checked before boarding. When I called Delta, I had originally asked for a flight change 24 hours before my flight due to change of travel plans and the fee was $384 to change to a new date one week later. Suddenly, the Delta airlines rep let me know that I can have the flight change for free since I had a bad experience originally on the first flight and long wait time."
410,1,15,March,2022,Premium Economy,Miami , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Let me start by saying I love Delta Air Lines. They get the max when it comes to the star category. Appearance great, service great, reps from - Miami (Ruben B) from the ticket area -such a wonderful human being. The flight attendants colors are great theyâ€™re professional and neatly dressed. Iâ€™ve loved this brand for years. "
411,3,14,March,2022,First Class,Atlanta , Providence        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," So I was scheduled to leave on 3/12/2022, they canceled my flight, every Delta representative was extremely rude except for the wonderful ladies at baggage claims in the Atlanta airport who worked the very early morning shift. I then come back today which is 3/13/2022 and my rebooked flight does not show on the departure board so I get in line to make sure and again was treated rudely. Before I could get out of the way they called up the next person. If this is how Delta allows the representative at airports to behave then they need a whole retraining course."
412,2,14,March,2022,Economy Class,Midway , Minnesota , Des Moines     ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," This has to be the worst experience ever. I booked a first class flight a week ago to make it back to work on time, and the flight took 2 hours to leave causing me to miss my second flight. Itâ€™s 9.17 pm now Iâ€™m stuck here overnight in the airport til 10.45 am and Delta said no hotel rooms. I will never fly Delta again and if you're reading this please donâ€™t cause yourself the headache, go to a different airline."

Hands down the worst, most inhumane flying experience weâ€™ve ever had. Flights changed at the last minute, multiple reps giving us completely different info, a missed connection due to an unexplainable delay (literally no one would tell us why despite asking everyone), and ultimately left stranded overnight at JFK w/ no hotel accommodation for a flight scheduled 13.5hrs after we passed security. And this was after being promised hotel accommodations by a Delta gate agent in Punta Cana. Reprehensible service all around."
414,10,13,March,2022,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Today was the worst Delta experience of my life. When I arrived to the airport, I stood in the baggage drop off line for about 2 hours. Then my flight 1217 was over 2.5 hours delayed. Then when we finally arrived to Atlanta, GA it took us another 30 mins because there were no people at the gate to guide us in. I typically donâ€™t write reviews for one bad experience, but I would have rather have taken Spirit Airlines today."
415,10,13,March,2022,Economy Class,Brunswick , Washington        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  The worse experience I've ever had. The crew members are rude. One of the crew members I approached give me an attitude and would not answer my questions. I had to wait for hours only to understand I would miss my connecting flight. I will not fly with Delta ever again. Delta needs to provide training to their crew members with attitude problems.
416,1,13,March,2022,First Class,Memphis , Cancun        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I will never fly with Delta again. This has been the worst travel experiences of my life. They left from Memphis, TN an hour and a half late because we were waiting for 2 passengers. Our connecting flight to Mexico left early with 1/3 of its passengers not on board. The earliest flight they will give us is Monday, which means we miss 3 full days of our scheduled vacation."
417,1,13,March,2022,Economy Class,Shanghai , Detroit , Seoul      ,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Honestly, my best flight with an American carrier in my whole life. I'm flying on the Delta One suite on their new A350-900. Well, the value for money wasn't great with the new pandemic regulations, so that is acceptable. To start it off, the cabin crew was great, just like the old times. Friendly and caring, showing that they really like their job and they are enjoying what they are doing. Off to a great start. A flight attendant specifically, has shown care and compassion throughout the flight to us. Off to a great start, Delta. Now, talking about comfort. The Delta One suite offered a comfortable space. I'm not tall, so I didn't experience any discomfort. It was heading straight, except for some curves which some other premium cabins consider for their business/first suites. Heading over to entertainment. It was truly a great variety, featuring all genres of movies and even new releases! But the music had its limitations, even by having a collaboration with Spotify. But it was good nonetheless. Wi-Fi wasn't connecting to my laptop, but it connected to my phone without a problem. Now talking about the food. It was absolutely delicious with its really premium feel to it, with 3 options. We were served lunch and breakfast. Between both meals, we could have snacks at any time if we felt hungry. Well, to conclude, this really was a great experience that absolutely blew my mind. Will for sure be flying with Delta again. See you next time Delta Air Lines!"
418,1,12,March,2022,Economy Class,Oklahoma City , Montego bay , Atlanta    ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  We left Oklahoma 45min late. Then we get to Atlanta to change flights and our connecting flight is delayed by 2 hrs. One hour before our delayed flight is due to depart we get delayed again by an additional 2 hrs. Our new departure time is 1hr past the time we should have arrived at our destination. We have missed a whole day of vacation!
419,3,12,March,2022,Economy Class,Billings , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Absolutely terrible. We were waiting to check our two bags while traveling with our large family of 6 for a week, and they told us that they couldnâ€™t check anymore bags after working so slowly that we might already miss our flight before they dropped the ball. After giving us a card to call with an invalid number they refused to help us and then couldnâ€™t actually check through security. Everyone was extremely rude before we got to the plane and they did nothing to accommodate our trip. Flight attendants were very sweet but that was about it. Would absolutely choose to never fly delta again. Getting to the airport an hour well before our flight made no difference than if we showed up 5 minutes before take off. Horrible way to start our vacation."
420,1,12,March,2022,Economy Class,Reno , San Diego , Los Angeles    ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This has been the most horrific travel experience our family has ever had. If we flew Southwest, we would have made it from Reno to San Diego in an hour and twenty minutes. However, thanks to Delta we've spent the last 8 hours traveling due to delayed flights, rude staff, and a the most chaotic, inefficient boarding system I've ever witnessed. In Los Angeles, they had five flights departing from the same gate. So after our first flight being delayed two hours, we figured we would miss our connection. However, due to the horror show at our connecting gate, we ended up two hours delayed again. The worst part was seeing the gal at the gate being rude and snippy to an elderly gentleman who was confused (like the rest of us) why five different flights were at the same gate and they were all behind. I will never book with Delta again. We could have drove faster. Don't waste your money or sanity with these folks."
421,1,11,March,2022,Economy Class,Dallas , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I have a family of 5. When we booked flight it did not let us choose seats. But we did look on website where it said that Delta tries to place families together. Once we received our seat assignments a couple days before flight we all 5 had random seats not one together. We called Delta, they stated get there really early and if you are the first they have a back row that they may be able to give. So we arrived 3 hours early before flight. Just to find out that at the gate they would not talk to us till 1 1/2 hours prior to flight. Then finally they talk to us and we tell them she says they are over booked I said thatâ€™s fine if we could at least get one of us with my youngest we will be ok. She said I will call my supervisor see what we can do to seat all together or at least 2 of you. Tells me to sit and she would let me know. So I sit and I see other family of 5 show up and talk to her after me. And she never comes back and says anything to me but the other family got to sit together. I would of been fine even if she would have at least came back to tell me hey Iâ€™m sorry we could not get you to sit with your youngest but the fact that she just said nothing really upset me. Every other flight I have take American Airlines spirit has never separated my family as bad as this airline did. I will never fly Delta again just for the fact of waste of time they made me do and the no care to even communicate with me."

The flight was from Orlando to Detroit! The crew knew it wouldn't take off before they loaded the crew. It wasn't even raining and flights after ours left before us but we got shut down. Wife and I lost a day's work, had nowhere to go and 2 kids under 5 with us. Just a joke and terrible excuse was due to safety. Won't be flying Delta anymore."
423,1,9,March,2022,Business Class,Calgary , Tampa , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Returning back to the US from Calgary is by the worst travel experience I've ever had. I got to the Airport 4 hours early to experience a horrendous line at WetJet. When I finally got to an agent to check in I was informed they could see my reservation, but could not let me board because there was an error from Deltas side... WestJet tried to fix however, I was told I needed to call Delta as it was from their end.. by this time I have less than 1.5 hours to board my flight to ATL. I tried calling Delta and there was a 3 hour hold time. I did not have time to wait on hold, I went back to the ticket counter and they said they only way I could get on the plane was to buy another ticket at $350 for a trip that was already paid for back in October! I was told I would have to retrieve my bag in ATL and recheck-in. On arrival in ATL went to get my luggage - no luggage! Went to get my boarding pass back to Tampa, it cost me an additional $78.72 and I experienced the most unprofessional and rude customer service I've ever had. When I tried to explain what happened, they made me feel like I had something wrong. After over 8 hours on hold this morning with Delta, I finally got a representative on the line and she said this is a WestJet issue, when I spoke with WestJet yesterday, they said this is a Delta issue because I booked through Delta.  I see nobody is going to be accountable or take responsibility for incompetence. So now I'm out over $400.00 for a trip that was booked and paid for in October and have no luggage."
424,1,8,March,2022,First Class,New York , Paris       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Delta one suites are the worst. Total rip off. Promoted as an amazing new product with privacy. Yes you have privacy but you are in a coffin. The seats are narrow and bottom half of your body goes into a 2x2 coffin with no ability to lie on side or move your legs. I would never fly again.  Better Air France or American Business Class. Changing my return flight home.
425,1,7,March,2022,Economy Class,Miami , New York       ,Direct Flight,Business,Spain, Trip Verified ," Buyer beware. There are no benefits to flying first class with Delta. No lounge access, ""lunch"" was a revolting microwaved to death rancid piece of chicken, and the seat no better than an emergency exit seat. No separate cabin. Quite how they get away with this given their misleading marketing is beyond me. Avoid avoid avoid. Rip off merchants."
426,5,6,March,2022,Economy Class,Melbourne , Norfolk , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  My day started with my 1st flight out of Melbourne with what started as a hour delay ended in a 6 hour delay with me missing my connection in Atlanta. Upon rebooking, I was assigned a new seat not of my choosing. There was no changing, no discussion, nothing, take it or leave it. Since Delta inconvenienced me at least they could have allowed me to keep my same like seat, ex. aisle for an aisle or window for a window. I usually don't fly Delta and have heard horrible stories from my friends. This experience has made me regret choosing to do so this time."
427,1,6,March,2022,Premium Economy,Minneapolis , Sioux Falls       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Absolutely horrible experience. Left 30 minutes late due to to the runway being busy and then when landed after the quick 36 minute flight, waited on the ground at Sioux Falls for over 1.5 hours fir a gate. Unbelievable. I would have got to Sioux Falls an hour earlier by just driving."
428,1,5,March,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Montego Bay       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Beware Delta. New thing is to re-assign your seat. In our case it meant from an aisle in row 16 to a middle seat in row 26. Whatâ€™s worse, no warning given. You learn as you board. Oh and it doesnâ€™t matter that you are a Gold traveling with a Diamond. To make matter worse, the gate agents get loud to embarrass you on the flight for asking what happened, and basically are rude and smug. They do nothing but almost mock you for being upset realizing you can do nothing about it. Fortunately other airlines are beginning to increase routes so even from Atlanta you donâ€™t have to be stuck in Delta. Terrible experience."
429,2,5,March,2022,Economy Class,Atlanta , Portland        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I checked in for my flight from ATL to PDX. I checked 1 bag ($30 fee) and was provided a boarding pass (seat 31A). I made it through security and waited at the gait for boarding. Once my boarding group was called I made it to the gate and was told someone was already seated in my seat and I needed to go to customer service. They couldn't or wouldn't assist and I was directed to a bank of phones to rebook a different flight (my flight that I had a seat for was full). After about a 40 minute process I was rebooked on a different flight - leaving 10 hours later and getting in at 10pm (my original flight was supposed to get in at noon). The phone agent suggested I go to an 11:15 flight to SEA to see if I could do standby and then onto PDX from there. Once I arrived at the gate they started the process, but after a few minutes said it was too difficult, there were only middle seats available and if I wanted to go forward with the standby it would cost $75. Wanting to save time I gave them my credit card and asked to be on standby. A few more minutes went by and the gate agent informed me that it was going to take too long and she could not do it. When providing a customer, a previously very loyal customer, a seat on an aircraft it a contract between the customer and the airline. This contract was broken - not only did Delta give me seat away that I paid for in good faith. They also wasted hours of my time, which is more of an issue. We are avid travelers and fly at least 20-30 times per year for both personal and business travel. Therefore, we feel we know how to navigate air travel."
430,1,3,March,2022,Business Class,Seattle , New Orleans       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Never again. Flew from Seattle to New Orleans with layovers on both flights (4 separate flights in total) and had an awful experience on all of them. Attendants blatantly ignoring the service light (happened on two flights), seats changed to the absolute back next to the bathrooms. Split up from my fiance twice - wifi not working on two flights Thoughts: Delta used to be one of the best. They are trash now, unattractive service is the only way to describe it. They just don't care, flying is supposed to be an awesome experience to see family or new places, and they just don't care."
431,1,2,March,2022,Business Class,San Juan , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Absolutely ridiculous that you cannot upgrade me to sit next to my husband as much as I fly. Both seats were open and available when I upgraded my husband's seat, Then for whatever excuse you want to give, I was unable to upgrade and sit beside him.  I have been very loyal to Delta in my travels. I have not complained about the 4 hour delays and flight cancelations of late, and I feel Delta does not seem to care about loyalty. So disappointing. This is the only time my husband has flown with me and I've been shown nothing but disrespect this entire trip."
432,1,2,March,2022,Economy Class,Paris , Houston        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta cancelled this flight and after a time agreed that I (my wife) was due a refund, which they say they sent to me on December 28th, 2021. Two and one half months later, still no refund. I have spoken to them on no less than 8 different occasions, filed notices, received Case numbers etc. etc. No amount of calls or texts or emails can persuade anyone to tell me where my $3,879 refund is."
433,1,28,February,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Anchorage Alaska , Salt Lake City ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta Airlines are absolutely not customer friendly, it's all about taking your money. My flight was scheduled 4 months in advance, then I get notice of a change in the flight and I try to cancel my flight, apparently Delta can change things and the customers can not. I tried to get a refund still three and a half months out from my departure date and Delta refuses unless cancelled within 24 hours. The flight that I was on was 90% full and it could very easily be filled in the next three and a half months but even so they are going to keep my money."
434,1,28,February,2022,First Class,New York JFK , Savannah      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Absolutely horrible. Seats are dirty. Tables are dirty. AC does not work for multiple seats. Plane has a horrible smell. Crumbs and filth all over the floor and arm rests. Flight attendants are terribly rude. While boarding, someone else stuck their incredibly large luggage above my seat (this passenger was seated nowhere near me.) The flight attendant made me leave the plane to check my bag in. There were valuables in the bag (the bag and itâ€™s contents were worth over $2,500.) I asked if the persons luggage could instead be removed from my space due to this and I was again told to just â€œcheck my bag.â€ I will never fly Delta again."
435,1,28,February,2022,Economy Class,Orange County , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I have flown Delta for the past 25 years. I have been on 3 flights with Delta in the last 4 months. Each one of these flights were terrible service. I have been surprised and shocked by the amount of bullying, lack of service or attention to passengers by 1st/business class crew members.  My last flight which was an overnight flight from LAX to Fort Lauderdale, which I booked business class. When I booked, I specifically asked if the flight had beds in the 1st/business class and I was told it did. Otherwise, I would never have spent the money I did to fly 1st/business overnight. Not only was there no bed - the seats didn't recline anymore then in the main cabin. I realize this sounds obnoxious to be complaining about 1st/business class seating. The issue is how much we pay for the seat and what it suppose to represent. Not only was there no bed or even an upgraded recliner seat, there were no blankets, no pillows, no service and a little snack in a cardboard box! It's pathetic and all under the disguise of Covid, yet all restaurants are open and serving people. Worst of all - the outbound flight was freezing. The cabin temperature was less then 65 degrees the whole trip. It was miserable! When I asked over and over for the cabin to be a bit warmer I was told how the cabin temp. was not controlled for my comfort, but rather the whole flight. I get it, but everyone was complaining. I won't even get started on the how aggressive the flight attendant was about masks up during sips of our drink. It's all shameful! I work very hard for my living, and in my business. I would never be allowed to treat my clients with so little regard. I wouldn't be allowed to bully or speak rudely to my clients either. I can't speak for everyone and by no means are all crew members bad - there are some great people out there working and doing their best each day. The issue and why I am taking my time to write this is the new lack of service, concern or care for passengers. I sincerely hope our country and these companies one day find their way beck to customer service and detailing services. Back to respect for all passengers whether 1st/Business or Main Cabin and stop looking at their profits or if they're properly diversified. Just hire the best person for the job, hold those people accountable and take care of ALL paying customers."
436,1,27,February,2022,Economy Class,Anchorage , Boston        , Seattle      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Terrible customer service. Itâ€™s not worth it! I have tried to contact customer service three times today and waited on hold for almost six hours to file a claim about a lost phone on a Delta flight. Considering the fact that there is a time limit to submit such a claim, itâ€™s ludicrous that Delta makes it so difficult to do so. The first time I called, the person told me to call a different department and just hung up on me, the department I was told to call was the wrong one and he couldnâ€™t help, the third one just transferred me to the airport lost and found without even taking the 5 seconds to hear that I lost it on the plane. To have paid for three round trip tickets through Delta this week and to get such terrible service is a slap in the face and delta should be ashamed to employ such incompetent people."
437,1,26,February,2022,Economy Class,Baltimore , Minneapolis        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  My newborn daughter and I flew in November 2021. It was an emotional trip and not an easy one to take but the Delta flight attendants made it so nice. On our return trip, the stroller that we gate checked was damaged. I contacted Delta and they worked with me to get the matter resolved and they reimbursed me. They have a process that they need to follow but I had a death in the family and was unable to comply. Rather than excluding me from reimbursement because I couldnâ€™t comply, they worked with me. Delta is a huge corporation and I am one in a million customers but they treated me like I was their only one. I recommend going with Delta!"
438,1,25,February,2022,Premium Economy,New York JFK , Montego Bay     ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We are Delta card holders and have always flown Delta but the increase in prices and elimination of basic fares will be ending our loyalty. Every other airline beats Delta fares and offer credit card rewards, as well. Itâ€™s a shame!"
439,1,25,February,2022,Economy Class,Minneapolis , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom, Trip Verified ," Minneapolis to Los Angeles. I typically fly first class for several reasons, the first and foremost reason being that there is extra room. I was flying from MSP to LAX. My husband and I have flown this several years ago and it was absolutely miserable. The seats were so tight that we couldn't even stand up. My husband is 5'10"" and about 165 pounds. He is very physically fit. His knees were against the back of the seat in front of us. The seats were so narrow and tightly squeezed that he started to have a panic attack and got sick. Because of this previous experience on Delta, I decided to get first class, however, the ticket was about $2,500 which was out of the question for this trip. I got their ""comfort plus"" seats. I'm 5'7"" and about a women's size 12- so not huge. Their comfort plus seats are a complete rip-off. They are the exact seats as coach with about 2 inches more of knee room. That's it. I asked the desk attendant about why their comfort seats aren't larger or more spacious and she said ""you're not paying for more room, you're paying for amenities."" Really? So I paid $400 more for a bag of chips and a $1.00 set of ear phones? Yes. Theoretically, the comfort plus is supposed to get on first to get that precious bag space above the seats, but even that backfired, as they allow anyone to go on during their ""comfort plus"" seating and although I sat in row 10, my bag had to be put over seat 16 which made retrieving it after the flight a nightmare. It's clear that Delta does anything possible to give you the very least of everything for the most money they can nickel and dime you for and I will no longer fly with them. I was a loyal frequent flyer with Northwest before it became Delta. Then I was a loyal Delta flyer until they decided to pack people in like sardines and do everything possible to screw us out of more and more money. I will only fly with them if they are the last resort and would even take the ""budget"" airlines over Delta now."
440,2,22,February,2022,Economy Class,Kansas City , Ft Lauderdale       , Atlanta    ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I fell asleep on the flight and my mask came down under my nose. They woke me up to put my mask over my nose. I went back to sleep and it happened again. After being harassed by not one but 3 flight attendants, they had a red coat pull me aside once we landed and barade me some more. They even threatened to kick me off of the next flight if I didn't sit there and take it. I'm comfortable with the fact that I will never fly with them again. I knew I should have flown on Southwest."
441,1,22,February,2022,Economy Class,Miami , Huntsville , Atlanta      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Flight from Miami arrived late in Atlanta. We (around 6 people) got to the gate 8 mins before the departure time with all other peopleâ€™s help and hustle. However door was shut and none of delta agents were willing to help. After we saw the flight left, the agent came out with indifference. We knew he gave away seats, but he was absolutely not concerned about us. Especially this gate agent was the worst one ever. It is just sad airline treat customers this way.."
442,10,21,February,2022,First Class,Key West , Toronto , La Guardia    ,Couple Leisure,Canada,Not Verified ,"  Can't say enough wonderful things about the staff at Delta. Our day started as a nightmare due to not having covid PCR test results in time in order to fly back to Canada. The check-in rep, flight crew, and customer service team on the phone all went out of their way to help us find solutions to get home that day, and we couldn't have done it without you. Thank you so much to the Delta staff at all touch-points."

When I spoke to an agent they put my on another flight home in coach and had no clue where my luggage would end up. I made it home had to call customer service took 1.5 hours. All they are going to refund me is $60!! Do not fly Delta, worst airline."
444,1,17,February,2022,Premium Economy,Salt Lake City , Amsterdam      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  During these Covid times one would expect greater care for cleanliness, however I found that on getting to my seat in Delta One, the whole area was dirty. There were crumbs and bits of food all over the tray table and seat. What's worse is I wrote a complaint to Delta and never received a reply. I sent another message to them two months later and still no reply. As a Platinum frequent flier I am very disappointed in Delta. When you pay $10,000 for a one way flight I expect to be treated better. It seems they do not care about my business."
445,1,16,February,2022,First Class,Atlanta , San Francisco       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," It was terrible. They literally gave me the wrong gate number on the e-pass. Even worse is I had to rebook and miss work because these people have such slow customer service. I had to repeat my name at least 4 times to the guy at the help desk. I mean really these guys are the worst and honestly, I would never fly them again."
446,2,14,February,2022,Economy Class,Seattle , Hartford CT , Atlanta     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified , My husband and I were flying home to Massachusetts to spend Thanksgiving with my brother. We purchased our refundable ticket online and checked refundable. Refundable was quite a bit more than nonrefundable. When our tickets printed it didnâ€™t have refundable on it it had the fine print about a nonrefundable ticket. Called Delta and they confirmed it was refundable so I did not purchase insurance. We were originally supposed to go via Minneapolis to Hartford but Delta changed Minneapolis to Atlanta to Hartford. Call them to see if we could just go Seattle to Atlanta to Hartford since we wouldâ€™ve been connecting with the Atlantic flight anyway. They said yes and told us we would be getting a refund of $233 per ticket. Well they ended up giving us a credit because they said we had a nonrefundable ticket. Galls me that they take your money and then donâ€™t want to give out back. I do not want the credit I want a refund. Contested it with charge company which credited my account but then Delta said no we had a nonrefundable ticket so our charge company charged it back. Next time I buy it airline ticket on any airline I will make a screenshot of every step to the purchase so I can prove that I bought a refundable ticket just based on the price.
447,10,14,February,2022,First Class,Tri Cities , Atlanta        , Midway     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified , I am always completely let down when my company books a Delta flight for me. This airline is a complete joke when it comes to customer service. About as rude and unprofessional as you could get. This includes help at the airport as well as the flight attendants. 
448,1,14,February,2022,Economy Class,Cincinnati , New York La Guardia ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified , Connecting fight was canceled due to â€œweatherâ€ which didnâ€™t make any sense as many other flights the same direction were taking off. Delta offered no lodging even though the only flight offered wasnâ€™t for almost 15 hours later. The airport wonâ€™t let you stay in a secure area. I have no idea where I am and no Delta personnel seem to care. Itâ€™s cold and Iâ€™m sitting on the floor in the front the airport with no type of security till the airport reopens. This is how Delta treats their sky priority first class ticket holders!
449,3,13,February,2022,Premium Economy,Boston , Los Angeles , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My flight was scheduled to depart from Boston to LAX. The flight got delayed, I called customer service and spoke to supervisor Andrew who talked to me like a machine and did not help me at all. He basically sounded like he wanted to hang up on me. Worst customer service ever. If you are flying national, please use American Airlines or another airline. Worst experience ever."
450,2,13,February,2022,Premium Economy,Rome , New York       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  This is by far the worst experience with Delta. The head flight attendant and another flight attendant were the rudest people Iâ€™ve ever encountered. I was in premium and my husband was in delta comfort. When we boarded I asked my husband to sit next to me since I have anxiety with take off. The plane was half empty. She approached us almost scolding at my husband for not being in his seat and snatched the headphone away. It wasnâ€™t about the seat being premium since the amenities were subpar to begin with. Iâ€™m not upset because of him going back to the seat but they were horrific and rude about it. They were both hostile towards me in a condescending tone.  As we were about to land my husband moved up so that he could retrieve the luggage from the overhead bin but the head flight attendant stormed over and said he could not sit there. I asked for her name and she raised her voice saying that she did nothing wrong.  As I was getting off the plane she told me to wait for a customer service person to speak to me. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I want is to wait even longer at the airport. She then responded with â€˜whateverâ€™. Iâ€™m horrified with her unprofessional behavior. Iâ€™d never fly with Delta again if thatâ€™s the representation of their service. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty as well. Considering they are the most expensive flight going to Europe thereâ€™s no value in it at all.
451,1,12,February,2022,Economy Class,Jacksonville , Detroit , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Normally I like Delta. But it has become like Spirit: Charge you for the ticket, charge you for the seat, charge you for one bag. Charge you for changing your flight. I might as well fly Spirit and save some money."
452,1,9,February,2022,Economy Class,London Heathrow , New Orleans , Atlanta    ,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Verified ,"  I was aware that Delta was Virgins US partner, and quite expected to fly Delta internally, the flight from Atlanta to New Orleans and return. What I did not expect was the flight booked with Virgin internationally would be with Delta also. The whole point of booking with Virgin was to travel with Virgin. I will be asking questions of them also. I was not told there would be a change until it came time to check in, and by then I could not change without losing money. Delta check in was OK. The crew seemed impatient at passengers taking their time to sit down and get comfortable. One female crew member was quite rude and sarcastic. Food was atrocious, and on an 8 to 9 hour flight we had one meal, and a snack. I talked to another passenger and she agreed, they didn't feed us very much. The flight itself was fine, and the crew member I had was lovely. My point being: Crew was not welcoming or even enthusiastic. Your passengers might have saved for the two years of Covid, looking forward to their holiday, encountering this experience, and dreading their return flight. The change from Virgin to Delta - I know this may not be your fault. The overall Delta experience was just not pleasant, and it should at least be that. I fly enough to know the good from the bad from the reasonable, and this experience was somewhere between the last two. Virgin on the way back, a whole other story - beautiful uniforms, young, helpful crew, nothing was too much trouble, even went an extra mile or two when I said I was slightly claustrophobic, and went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable. I really want to fly with Virgin again, but if I know that journey will also include Delta? I might seriously think twice."
453,1,9,February,2022,Premium Economy,Miami , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Both our flight to and our return flight where very uncomfortably and unbearably hot. The attendants focused too much on the masks on and not enough on our comfort. On the return flight we were extremely thirsty, as they only provided drink beverages once vs twice as they did on our first flight. Which just amplified the fact that everyone was very hot. Horrible air circulation. Also, we checked our bags in using the Kiosk, only to find out we still had to make the long counter lines to check in bags. Because they were short staffed. Very disappointed on the service, definitely not he Delta airlines we were used to."
454,1,8,February,2022,Economy Class,Punta Cana , Atlanta        , Miami     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Frontier cancelled our flight, and after rebooking with Delta we realized that the Frontier ticket agent had kept our negative Covid paperwork. The Delta agents were amazing! The gate agent calmed me down, and booked us on the next flight, the ticketing agents found us seats and walked with us to expedite security so that we would make the boarding after obtaining our luggage from Frontier. The Delta staff in Punta Cana made a nightmare travel situation better. I had purposely avoided Delta when the became â€œpoliticalâ€ but this experience will make me reconsider."
455,1,7,February,2022,Economy Class,Orlando , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Iâ€™m on flight 1535 from Orlando to Atlanta. the plane is 757-200 and when my family and I boarded a very nasty lady at the boarding gate asked us to check out bags. This means she allowed all previous passengers to board with more than a carry on. We have 3 small carry on we used to flight light from EWR to MCO to spend the weekend. If this is the service Delta provides then is very poor and unacceptable. We are trying to go back to reality and back to traveling. If Delta doesnâ€™t know how to instruct the employee so that the rules are valid for some passengers only then it is useless to be a member, to have delta Amex cards and to try to support what I thought was a good airline."
456,7,6,February,2022,Business Class,Minnesota , New Orleans       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified , I purchased airline tickets with Delta last April and had to cancel them due to Covid-19. When I was issued the credit I was told that I would have access to the whole credit for future travel no matter who was flying. When I tried to use my credit today I was told that I was only allowed to use a portion of the credit because of the way the agent issued the credit. I was also told that if the other passengers would lose the credit. I paid for the tickets with my credit card and was told that I was able to use the whole credit. Iâ€™m not a happy customer and donâ€™t plan on using Delta Airlines again. Itâ€™s not fair that I was told one thing at the time of the cancelation and then told something else when I tried to use the credit today. Iâ€™m losing a lot of money and very upset about it.
457,5,5,February,2022,Economy Class,Newark , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," First, I don't quite understand the overwhelming number of horrible ratings on United in particular and US carriers in general. I am not sure if I was lucky or I am not demanding, but my experience with the airline was quite fine so far (knock on wood). It is certainly not top notch but not horrible either. I, for sure, have encountered unpleasant experiences, but that happened to me even with the best rated airline. I think US carriers' weak spot is ground operations, with so many short, small flights that are plagued with delays, cancellations and gate changes (Asian full-service carriers use wide-body aircrafts even on one-hour flights). Now, here is my opinion about this particular flight. Ground service at EWR for Premier class was seamless but not exemplary, and that was certainly below the level of Delta One. In-flight hard product was where this flight shined. The 787-10 was shiny and clean. The Polaris seats were comfortable, spacious, and last but not least, provided a great deal of privacy. This was one of, if not the best equipment for a 5-6 hour flight I ever experienced, even when compare with intra-Asia business class from top rated airlines. On board staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food choices were limited, but I can see improvement on the taste. Food service and presentation was not quite at, though were inching back to, pre-pandemic level. The flight departed on-time and arrived early, but we were still late as we had to wait for our arriving gate, a LAX signature. The IFE screen was nice and responsive, though movie selections were not as good as what on Delta. Overall, I have no complaints."
458,6,5,February,2022,Economy Class,Portland , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I needed to call Delta due to them being unable to add my lap infant online when I tried. When I called they said the hold time would be 5 hours. As I said, I have a small infant and needed to make sure this was done so I had no choice but to wait the time. Unlike other businesses that are all understaffed they do not give you the option to keep your place in line and receive a call back like everyone else. The fact that they feel somehow like people that are spending hundreds of dollars with them have the ability to do nothing else that sit and listen to hold music. The kicker to this is after 3 hours and 47 minutes yes, it just hung up on me. I will never, ever in my life fly this airline again. You can push people only so far Delta."
459,9,4,February,2022,Economy Class,Detroit , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Such a bad service. I have been waiting for 4 hours because just because one of the crew didnâ€™t arrive on time. Its really hard and I have to cancel and reschedule all of my connection flight and none of crew members give a clear explanation.
460,5,4,February,2022,Economy Class,Pittsburgh , Tampa , Detroit      ,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Actually have not had this flight yet, happens tomorrow. My complaint is with their app and their customer service. I needed to catch an earlier flight out of Pittsburgh due to weather and I wanted to get home earlier. The weather actually forced me to wait until it was within 24 hours of the flight. The app has an option for changing your flight within 24 hours built into the UI. It allowed me to go all the way through putting in my CC number and billing info and repeatedly would not work. Now mind you, this is the second time this has happened to me using Deltas app. On both occasions, I had to reach out to customer service for help, and as most of you know who have ever had the displeasure of having a need for their help, you can expect to wait a long time. So after waiting 2 hours for them to reach out to me via their text messaging service, the seats that were available 2 hours prior were gone and the flight I needed was fully booked. How they can honestly say thanks for being the best part of Delta after providing terrible service is beyond me. Most likely will not use Delta again. I need better flexibility in my travel than they can apparently provide."
461,1,3,February,2022,Economy Class,Orange County , Seattle       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Recent changes has made this airline very unfriendly. If you buy a basic economy, the lowest fare, you have to pay a penalty of about $90 if you change or cancel the flight. No exception even if you get Covid. No mileage added for this kind of ticket. It's impossible to talk or chat with a live person. The wait is usually over an hour no matter when you call. It's no longer my preferred airline."
462,9,3,February,2022,Business Class,Minneapolis , Fargo        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  AA stranded us in Minneapolis and so Delta Airlines stepped up to get us to Fargo. I was impressed so when approached to complete a survey, I quickly complied! I filled out every page and raved about the quote displayed on the Delta monitors ""Kindness and patience go a long way!"" Then, I had an issue .and a scene was displayed. We had been left in Dallas on the runway by AA due to de-icing problems, not allowed to retrieve our luggage, rented a room there, returned to DFW in the morning and flown to MSP at noon and then nothing. A plane full of people who paid top dollar to fly to Fargo and couldn't. Delta promised to get us home, but not without drama. My husband was able to get out on the 3:30 flight but my grandson and I had to fly standby for the 7:40 flight which we didn't make so we had to wait for the 11:50 pm flight. I went up to the desk for clarification on a confirmed seat and presented the gate agent the paper ticket and she said ""I don't know what that is!"" so I dropped it on the desk for her to punch in the computer to which she replied ""this isn't a trash can honey"" I was shocked and so was my Grandson. Disrespectful, rude. When we went back to get her name, a Burgundy jacket Delta rep asked why I wanted her name and then told me no. Then said it wasn't his area and went to the next desk. Unbelievable. Very disappointing."
463,1,2,February,2022,Economy Class,Denver , Santo Domingo       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," I bought business class tickets for the comfort it provides especially flying internationally. My connecting flight from JFK to SDQ not only got delayed, but it got changed and I got downgraded to economy class. Needles to say, if it wasnâ€™t out of necessity, I would not be flying with Delta. Gave them a chance and I got let down, again."
464,1,31,January,2022,Economy Class,San Antonio , Sarasota       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Delta has made it the norm to disappoint travelers. I understand that we are experiencing a global pandemic, but it is getting ridiculous. Travelers rely on this airline to be reliable. They have not. Delayed flights are the norm; we were just taken back to the gate after sitting in the tarmac for over an hour with absolutely no information of the issue. Either get the organization right or quit accepting the money from travelers to only disappoint. This is becoming the norm and getting really old and disappointing."
465,1,29,January,2022,First Class,New Orleans , Raleigh Durham       , Atlanta     ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Worst Experience ever! I was flying on 01/28/22 from New Orleans to Raleigh. On my trip to Atlanta, I spent 10 hours in the airplane. They added fuel twice and diverted us to Huntsville, AL. Than they dumped us at 1:00am in Atlanta. No gate agent, no support, nothing. I spent the night at the airport. It is Saturday 12:00pm. I was confirmed on an 11:10am flight and now they can't get the flight crew together because they did had enough sleep. I did not sleep at all, since yesterday morning! How unprofessional can you be. I travel every weekend and have no desire to spend my free time at the airport. Do you pay me for the day I lost Delta? No Delta for me until they figure out how to run their business!"
466,2,29,January,2022,Premium Economy,Honolulu , Phoenix , Los Angeles     ,Business,United States,Not Verified , First class priority boarding. You get on a bus with everyone else. All those who got on the bus after you did get off first and take up all the overhead bin space. So glad I paid for a first class ticket. This is wrong on every level of customer service. Shame on you Delta. I have to gate check because your staff is to shy to ask those you stuffed there bags in first class overhead to remove and gate check those bags.
467,7,29,January,2022,Economy Class,Mexico City , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Was diverted from Atlanta to Birmingham. No customs agents on hand, Crew timed out, still stuck on plane 5 hours and counting with no end in sight. No food offered, no drinks offered for last 2 hours. Complete chaos of a situation. If this was a NYC to Atlanta flight. I am sure things would have been handled differently, but from Mexico City, ahh let them rot on tarmac."
468,2,28,January,2022,Economy Class,Redmond , Las Vegas , Seattle     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  If you donâ€™t have enough overhead space, maybe make the the folks with bigger bags check? Changing my flights constantly so I now have a 5 hour layover. Longer than the flight times put together. Truly garbage customer service. On top off boarding passes not have the gate on them. This is the worst experience on a trip ever. I thought Iâ€™d give them a try but it was a huge mistake."
469,1,26,January,2022,Economy Class,Des Moines , Panama City , Atlanta    ,Business,United States,Not Verified ," When it comes to them answering calls for me to book a flight thereâ€™s no problem. When I wanted to make a complaint, they say thereâ€™s 3 1/2 hours or more of hold time, and with multiple attempts, I always get disconnected after about an hour or so on the phone. I tried to do it through text and online, but still no one wants to help me. They refer me back to the phone number, which doesnâ€™t let me connect to a live rep. There were multiple issues with my connecting flights, costing me an extra $2000 to get home. Thereâ€™s a huge laundry list of other issues but I donâ€™t have all day to write them down. Suffice it to say I will try using a different airline than Delta, they were horrible."

She was very accurate, courteous, eager to help me, and very nice. I needed confirm that my KTN # and Sky Miles # were added to my ticket. Priceline had assured me they were. Well they were not. Grace Marie with Delta Airlines took care of everything for me. She was a breath of fresh air after the hours I had spent on the phone with my rental car agency and Priceline. "
471,5,23,January,2022,Premium Economy,Colorado Springs , Honolulu       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Disappointing to fly Delta. All four flight segments were late, some critically. Paid for First Class and that was a mistake, I will never do that again with this airline. Rather than make a laundry list of all the issues we encountered, suffice to say that it became a high stress trip and it should not have been. Avoid paying for upgraded seats on Delta domestic flights, it comes with nothing, itâ€™s a bus ride, nothing more. I will try to avoid this airline when possible on future trips."
472,3,22,January,2022,Economy Class,New York , Las Vegas      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Booked a trip from Colorado Springs to Honolulu with a connection through SLC. Arrived to SLC to find out that my flight to Honolulu was delayed by 7 hours 40 minutes. Went to help desk to ask about other options and was told that there were no options. Since I have time I look myself, I go back and ask about the multiple options I found and they finally agreed to look. They then tell me I can go through Seattle so I reluctantly agree. When I asked about my seat upgrade I paid for they just laughed and told me to ask about it at the gate. They booked both flights with a middle seat when there were plenty of options. I am currently sitting in the plane to Honolulu waiting for them to figure out which flight attendant staff will be joining us because they want ours to go to South Korea instead. Fully loaded plane ready to go! Told us it would be 30 minutes and has been almost an hour. This airline is the absolute worst for customer service and logistics. Not once was I treated with respect or sincerity. I will never fly Delta again. And to think these airlines are the first to cry for bailout money when things get tough only to layoff their staff and jack prices up all while quietly buying back stock options."

Our new departure time changed from 12:45pm to 1:45pm to 2:20pm and then 4:15pm. Absolutely unacceptable. Delta will do almost anything to not refund you your money. Iâ€™ve only ever flown with them twice and both experiences were dreadful. I donâ€™t even know how they have a 4/10 review rating because it needs to be at 0. Iâ€™m completely done with Delta theyâ€™re just not worth all the hassle and obstacles. We were flying domestic and they donâ€™t seem able to handle such trips."

Flight was delayed 20 min due to ""short staff"" as told by the pilot on intercom system. Arrived in New York 30 minutes late then had to wait another 15 minutes to be taxied to tarmac. The pilot then came on the intercom and stated ""nothing we can do we are short staffed just waiting on taxi to tarmac"". We missed our plane connecting to BWI. We were told to go to help desk. When we got to help desk they offered a plane ticket for 6.5 hours later with a 15.00 food voucher for 2 people to eat at the airport. We asked for a supervisor, the lady told us to stand aside. We were then told that the supervisor was busy on the phone right now and there was nothing else they could do. We complained then the supervisor came out and told us that it was not Deltas fault. I said your pilot told us you were short staffed, I said so are you. She said I canâ€™t give out that information. It was unbelievable how we were treated and Delta did not take responsibility at all for us sitting at the airport for an extra 6.5 hours due to their own fault. Never again will I use this airline. This is not how I want to end my vacation. Due to the high cost of tickets the way this whole situation was handled unprofessionally. First and last time this family will use Delta."

Delete flight time to later time just like that, that is make missing connection flight. Before boarding started tagging my bag to the final destination. They do not care you are missing connection flight and can has no bag finally in the hotel. They do not listen you problem. Delta is really bad and sad experience but charging much like a good service. Broken day! Crew on board has last 2 rows empty but did not allowed to seat there in case to feel more space, even in that bad situation. Use Delta only like last call"
476,3,15,January,2022,Economy Class,Honolulu , Austin , Los Angeles     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Had to change my flight due to a family emergency. I thought I had completed it (at no charge) but when I got to the airport they could not find my new flight or my original departure flight. After some searching it was determined that in my haste to change the flight I inadvertently changed the time only but on the original date. Because I had already changed it once I was going to have to pay for the second change. She took the time to speak to a manager and figure it out. Non-stop to my destination without an extra charge. Totally a positive outcome!
477,2,15,January,2022,Premium Economy,Puerto Vallarta , Seattle       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," We were traveling from Honolulu to Austin via LAX. The flight was overbooked so Delta asked for volunteers to give up their seats. My wife and I said what the heck, letâ€™s do it. Another night in Honolulu! Well, Delta gave us each $1500, a free night at the Marriott resort downtown, and free round trip transportation to and from the hotel. The young Delta employee at the gate was most helpful (in spite of the late hour). In the process we hired an Uber driver who was a charm. He was Korean and spoke little English, but enough to get us to the Marriott. Once we arrived, he helped us with our bags, and told us he would be there to pick us up the next morning. We told him that we had to be at the airport at 6 am and he said no problem. The next morning, sure enough, he was there waiting for us, with donuts as a treat! We tipped him nicely. BTW my wife bought an Oculis with the money, and booked us on another flight to Honolulu (our son, daughter-in-law and young grandson live in Honolulu). Thanks, Delta, for a really great time and for meeting some great people!"

Being 5 foot tall, the extra legroom was not a factor for me in my purchase. What was a factor was the comfort items said to come with this premium seating; a pillow, blanket, etc. I was very disappointed to be told on both of my delta flights that neither a pillow nor a blanket could be provided to me. I was actually very uncomfortable the entire flight as it was very cold and there were no pillows and blankets that I could get, even though that is the entire point of comfort plus seating."

Arriving at the airport in Hartford at 3am on Sunday, December 5, we found that we had not printed out the final authorization from the government authorizing our entry into the country, though it was on our phones. The Station Manager was ever so patient and kind and smart, because it was not easy to download them, and print them on Delta's printer, which we sent using her email. After quite a bit of trying, she met us at the gate to continue attempts until she finally succeeded in printing the forms out for us. She literally saved our vacation. The rest of the Delta staff, on all 4 legs of our trip, coming and going to St. Lucia were also patient, courteous and professional. The flights were clean and on time and reasonably comfortable. They had Peloton meditation and chair yoga videos as part of their on line entertainment, which I enjoyed. In this very stressful time for air travel, it is nice to have only good things to say about these flights, and this airline. We plan to switch our frequent flyer mile credit card to them. The snacks and beverage were standard airline basic but the people serving them were great."

After the conversation I received an email the it was an e-credit so I called again and was told by a 2nd rep that it will be changed to a full refund and I will have it back to my credit card within 7 days. When I did not receive the credit I contacted Delta on Jan 3rd and was recited their policy that it is an non refundable flight and there will be no refund. When I explained I was told by 2 reps that I would I was told you were given wrong information and you will not get a refund. I also explained we couldn't fly due to Covid and if we did we would have infected far to many people again I was told sorry that's our policy and the rep literally hung up on me. I waited a few days and called yet again to be told again sorry that's our policy. I would think and hope that a company like Delta would care a little more for their passengers especially in the trying times we are in. Delta just really doesn't care and are not compassionate to what this pandemic is doing to people. Its so sad they are willing to hold their policy against a family instead of understanding."

My work ended up postponing the trip until April because the Omicron cases were high. My ticket total was 650 dollars. I called Delta to postpone the tickets until April. They said sure, but you will have to pay a 99$ fee for every reschedule. Totaling 300$, and on top of that, I won't even get refunded the 350$. Instead It'll be taken as an e-credit. The customer service was so dry and uncaring about it. I was on hold for 2 hours for a text message associate, that then told me to get connected to customer care, which was another 2 hour wait, then when i got connected I explained my situation and they said I can't help you, but I can add you to the customer care queue. They were the reservation queue. I told them, I didn't really want to stay on hold for another few hours. As I've already been on hold for 4 hours.... they said, Ok, let me check the queue, and abruptly connected me to the customer care queue. Where I ended up waiting another 2 hours. And I still got the same result. Worst airline ever. I'm never flying Delta again."

My wife and I were headed to Jamaica. Got to airport in plenty of time there was maybe 30 people in line to check bags, our friends got through and half way through checking our bags the classy individual working the delta counter said times up. No warning nothing, (this is my first time ever flying) then we were handed an 800 number to call for Delta which was even a bigger joke. We ended up booking another flight through American to get to Jamaica after already having paid tickets through delta. Sickening customer service"
484,10,9,January,2022,Business Class,Detroit , Charlotte        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I had a flight from Seattle to Cancun on this Saturday 08th, 2022 and due health problems I had to cancel I tried to call Delta by phone and the waiting time was about 2hrs 45 min, so I found another way via chatting that at the end of the day it was more or less the same to time to make it possible to have an answer from Delta. After that time the person came to me to tell me that no matter ticket was sold by Delta, the flight would be operated by Aeromexico and they cannot do much in regards of cancelling the flight I told the lady I had to wait more than two hours on line to get such answer? What a terrible service."
485,1,7,January,2022,Economy Class,Panama City , Edmonton , Los Angeles     ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Purchased the comfort+ option, as to be able to change my flight time if needed at no cost. Delta clearly states this is a benefit of this option when selling it while booking a ticket. Still they charged me $75 to make a change to a later flight on the same day. Itâ€™s over 3hrs to wait on the phone for customer service. At the airport every Delta personnel I tried to get help from with this started their response with, ""Iâ€™m sorry but unfortunately"".. No one budged to help me in the least. Iâ€™m a fairly even-toned individual and have a dry sense of humor so I pointed the Delta typical trainee Iâ€™m sorry but unfortunately bs, out to the woman at the gate to have her get extremely loud and embarrassing and I actually get threatened a bit. As I tried to go to a seat, this woman kept approaching me and being loud until I finally had to get somewhat loud myself and ask her to leave me alone. The worst of customer service I've ever experienced."
486,1,7,January,2022,Economy Class,Orlando , Detroit        ,Direct Flight,Business,Canada, Trip Verified ,"  This was the first and the last time for sure, not even for free we will fly again with Delta, we thought we've seen it all, nope, Delta is the worst by far. On the way down, the co-pilot didn't show up, waited for an hour for one from New York while we are in the plain. On the way back, Delta's staff in Panama don't know the regulation and don't know English, they didn't know that we don't need a visa to enter USA, made us wait for an hour and half to verify our Canadian passports. Every time we asked, we were treated like criminals, almost lost the flight."
487,1,6,January,2022,Economy Class,Milwaukee , Jacksonville , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Orlando to Detroit. I booked a ticket to Detroit from Orlando I have two of my kids with COVID and my dad who I am traveling to testing positive along with his wife and brother. I have been trying to reschedule my flight yesterday and today I was on the phone yesterday on hold waiting for 6 hours and than got disconnected. Today so far I am on hold for four hours and still no one answered.
488,1,5,January,2022,Economy Class,Tampa , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Our flight started out early morning 40 minutes late from original departure. Knowing we were coming in late Delta decides to close our next flight 5 minutes early at the gate. Next flight we could get, on standby, was 5 hours later. On our first flight there was an attendant yelling at people to keep their mask on while handing them food so they could pull their mask down to eat right after. When my wife went to go politely rebook our flights the Delta clerk rolled her eyes at her. The insanity and lack of compassion from this airline is aggravating so I urge people to not use this airline. The staff have an attitude/entitlement problem and itâ€™s not worth it considering the ticket costs."
489,1,4,January,2022,Economy Class,Portland , Bordeaux , Amsterdam      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  My son just turned 2, and they insisted he wear a mask on the plane. I know that might not sound like a tedious request to some, but for many people with children 2 and under know how hard it is to travel with small children. And then to add having to make sure your 2 year old keeps his mask on for 2 hours, is another task. The staff were not polite about it either. They actually said they would kick me, and my 2 small children, off the plane, if I couldnâ€™t keep my 2 year old babies mask on. However, if they would have politely said: ""maâ€™am we know your son is a baby, and you are dealing with making sure you have all of your luggage, your children are safe beside you, and getting to your seat. But when you are sitting down could you try and keep your sons mask on"". I would have appreciated that much more. We are frequent flyers, and have never been asked to make sure my baby under 2 feet tall, is wearing a mask by any other airlines. This staff obviously do not have children. Amongst the chaos of traveling alone, to be sympathetic to a single mother, with 2 small children the staff member at the front gate, was incredibly rude when telling me to put a mask on my baby. There were several passengers behind me that actually expressed how rude she was, and sympathized with me on how hard it is to travel with small children. The Flight Manager, announced to half of the plane he was going to kick us off the flight, if it was impossible to keep my 2 year oldâ€™s son from pulling his mask off. For Delta managers: This is flight number: DL2596 Writing this review for single parents with small children during Covid. I would not advise flying Delta. I will never choose this airline again."
490,1,4,January,2022,Economy Class,Newark , Atlanta        , Paris CDG     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Good quality flight. Was on Comfort+ for the Seattle to Amsterdam segment. Seats are comfortable enough for me to sleep a minimum and without seeking any paid upgrade. Professional cabin crew and easy airport transition in Amsterdam for connection.
491,1,4,January,2022,Economy Class,Anchorage , Salt Lake City , Seattle    ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," Am very astonished and disappointed by Delta International's conduct on my trip in November from Newark to Madrid. I checked in at EWR and left my small suitcase to be checked. The agent asked for $75. I told him that I am entitled to one free checked piece of luggage because 1) I have a DELTA SKYMILES AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD CARD I paid for the ticket with and 2) I am a SILVER MEDALLION/SKY MILES ELITE member. He asked to see my Amex card and I showed it to him and he returned it and said all was fine and gave me my boarding passes and claim check. It wasn't until I was onboard my flight from Atlanta to Paris (AF) that I discovered that he'd taken the Amex card and swiped it, charged me $75 anyway, and had hidden the charge receipt behind all of my boarding passes. That is so dishonest and deceptive. I wrote to Delta to complain and two months ago I received an e-mail that just said they were going to notify the concerned departments of this issue. To me, this is theft of services and I don't know if I should forget about it or call the police. The staff at the gate was very professional and handled my business documents correctly."
492,5,4,January,2022,Economy Class,New Orleans , Boston        , La Guardia    ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Terrible experience, extremely disappointing as my experience with Delta all the way up to this point has been great. I was going from Anchorage to Salt Lake City, with a layover in Seattle. The first flight had serious turbulence and movement, which wasn't Delta's fault. What was their fault was the fact that they had no barf bags anywhere in my row. As you can imagine, this caused a problem. The second problem arose with the layover timing, which was a ridiculously small time frame to get from the first flight to the second flight, which was accentuated by the fact that the first flight was around 20 minutes late though it claimed to be ""on time."" And then, after all of that, they lost our luggage. They claimed it would be here this morning in a ""worst-case scenario,"" but we're still waiting. It's still in Seattle, with no info on when it will be here. This was a nightmare travel experience."
493,2,2,January,2022,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Oakland      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I have never been so frustrated and disappointed by an airline in my life. In my trip from New Orleans to Boston on January 1st, 2022, I had 4 flights cancelled. My original flight from MSY to ATL to BOS was cancelled, and then I was rebooked from MSY to LGA to BOS, which was also cancelled. I was then put on standby from MSY to JFK to BOS, managed to get on that flight to JFK, and was supposed to have a 6 hour layover - I was able to switch to flight DL675 to BOS so I wouldn't be getting home at 11 PM, and was told by the Delta employee who rebooked me that my flight would be protected--that was then cancelled, and I was told I could not even get on the standby list for the 8:59 PM flight to BOS that I had switched from. I talked to a Delta employee and asked him to cancel the 7:00 AM flight (5762) I was automatically rebooked onto for the next day and request my luggage so I could leave the airport and take an Amtrak home. I waited for 5 hours on the baggage claim floor for my bag (with at least 10 other people doing the same), and was told by the 4th Delta employee I spoke to, 4 hours into waiting, that the 3 Delta employees I had already spoken to who said my flight was cancelled and my bag was requested had actually done nothing. The one competent, nice Delta employee finally requested my bag for me â€” I then waited another 45 minutes, and then that same employee gave me a file number and took my home address to have my bag delivered to me so I could leave the airport, since it was already 11 PM. By the time I left the airport to go to a hotel so I could catch an Amtrak in the morning, it was too late to cancel my flight, despite the fact that I was told by multiple Delta employees that they cancelled it for me. I had to purchase a hotel room, an Amtrak ticket, and leave without my bag and just hope it actually gets delivered to me. I will absolutely never fly Delta again."
494,1,1,January,2022,Economy Class,Philadelphia , Minnesota        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Bad customer service.

I was supposed to fly at 3pm to Minnesota but was canceled and rebooked me to Atlanta, then had to wait there for 3 hours and continue flying to MN, arrived at 12.30 midnight. I will never book Delta Air Lines again."

We tried to call, we sent messages, no response, nobody could help at the airport. My flight arrived on 12/30/21 around 2:15 pm, and my baggage was supposed to come on the next flight at 4:30pm but nothing. Today is 12/31/21 I have no medications, no clothes no shoes and still nobody can help. Iâ€™m very disappointed and I will guarantee I will never travel with them again."
497,2,31,December,2021,Economy Class,Anchorage , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Absolutely the worst customer service, I was a loyal member to Delta but that is no longer, I had 2 flights canceled back to back, then zero support from the staff on getting my flight canceled. I decided to trust them again trying to fly back home and again was let down in every way possible. Not to mention to check your bag takes hours on end, I thought showing up 2.5 hours early for my flight was enough and I couldnâ€™t of cut it any closer I had to run through the terminals and was lucky that the lady opened the door for me. the only time I will ever fly with them again is to use my points and then it is adios."
498,1,31,December,2021,Economy Class,Detroit , Houston        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified , Customer service is the worst especially for the military my son flew in on the 18th and was scheduled to leave back out on 12/31 only to receive and email saying his flight was canceled 4 hours before he was scheduled to leave. The customer service rep we spoke with was beyond rude and told us to pick another day or lose money. Itâ€™s nice to know that your company cares so little about people who help keep your country safe.
499,1,30,December,2021,Economy Class,Pennsylvania , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This was such a horrific experience Iâ€™ll never fly Delta again. Three days in a row they cancelled the exact same flights, and had one of the flights delayed by the exact same 4 hours each evening and yet claimed each occurrence of having no crew was random. Gate agents were either clueless or rude, many were unable to perform reticketing that I was able to do through my app. Somewhere around the evening of day two of waiting, they gave everyone meal vouchers, which might have been nice had a single restaurant been open once they decided to give them to us. One agent told me that if you leave security, you canâ€™t come back through (clearly untrue). One agent told me they could not put me on a partnering airlines flightâ€¦I confirmed with someone else that they are required to do so if they cannot serve you (they could not, it was going to be more than 24 hours). So I went back up to counter, asked again more finely and they agreed. But, she â€œhad trouble with the systemâ€ miraculously until exactly the minute after I could no longer make that flight. They made people wait for 7 hours in the airport for flights where no crew had been scheduled and none would be coming available, three days in a row. On our last delay, we were told â€œthey hoped our crew, arriving from another city, wouldnâ€™t time out before being able to fly.â€ Iâ€™m sorry, you donâ€™t know whether the crew were waiting for is going to be eligible to fly? Seems like someone should have that information, right? I donâ€™t blame the airline for a cancelled flight, or even 8 cancelled flights. I blame them for a combination of stupidity and actual deception that cost many people a lot, and for a complete callous disregard for the feelings of customers. I watched every other airline handle limited crew with no issues and with some kindness and empathy. Delta employees clearly didnâ€™t care at all, and Iâ€™m done with them."
500,1,30,December,2021,Economy Class,Seattle , Denver        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Very happy with Delta. We got delayed due to weather issues and staff shortages due to covid in Detroit and Delta made sure we had free hotel stay, free shuttle, and food vouchers. We came back every day to see if there was any flights and the attendants were very extremely helpful. One in particular, Mara in Detroit, took extra time to see what options we could take to get home earlier. So instead of Getting home Friday we were able to get home on Wednesday! Mara deserves a raise! Thank you Delta for such amazing service! And please thanks Mara for me!"
501,2,29,December,2021,Economy Class,Phoenix , Detroit        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," The flight to Denver was a nightmare having us stuck on the tarmac in Seattle for 2.5 hours due to an engine malfunction on the runway. The the return flight was cancelled with Delta providing no assistance or other options to get home and  their website was down not allowing people to get their refunds for the tickets. The only option was to call Delta's phone number which currently has a 4.5 hour wait time with no call-back option available. Long story short, this trip is the prime reason I stick to Alaska Airlines whenever possible and a reminder that it isn't always worth saving an extra $50."
502,1,29,December,2021,Economy Class,Providence Rhode island , Minneapolis      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  I was told at the counter that there were not any first class tickets available to do an upgrade. After going through security and coming up to the gate and talking to the rep owner I was informed that there were seats available but I had to use a courtesy phone. Hold time is 5 hours. This is the most ridiculous customer service Iâ€™ve ever experienced. Who in their right mind since itâ€™s OK to have a customer on hold for five hours.
503,1,29,December,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , Houston        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Multiple delayed flights. Hours long waits in planes and airports. Flight from Detroit left when we were on the ground ready to make connecting flight. They knew we were on the ground. Left anyway leaving us with several hour wait. Staff unhelpful helping us to get off the plane first knowing we had 26 minutes to get on the connecting flight. Unable to get off plane in Minneapolis because another plane used our unloading platform knowing full well we were on time, even early. Only one info desk to assist with making new flight arrangements. Staff slow. At least 30 people in line ahead of us. Waited over an hour. Cleaning crews late making boarding late. Have been at airports and on planes since 11 this morning. It is now midnight with no end in sight. Hired transport company left us after making 2 trips to airport and waiting for over an hour."
504,2,29,December,2021,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham , San Antonio Airport      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Since boarding my flight from Atlanta to Houston the customer service was nasty, I was moved from gate to gate with absolutely no communication the only way I knew was looking up at the board and seeing the boarding attendant gone and the flight no longer posted (this happened 3 times) again absolutely no announcement, My carry on is damaged while trying to board the plane, now I am not at the correct airport I am spending an extra $75 and an hour away from the airport I was told we would be landing at by one of the attendants. I dont want to forget to mention the seats and windows on the plane were sticky and had what looked like cola drops on the windows. I will not be flying Delta again."
505,10,27,December,2021,Economy Class,San Jose , Omaha       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  While at the gate and returning from San Antonio, Texas on December 26, 2021, customer service asked for any courteous traveler to check their carry on luggage in order to make sure everyone had room. Being a retired USAF service member, I thought I would be able to serve again by checking my carry on luggage, therefore freeing up an additional space for other passengers. I sat down by the window facing the aircraft and noticed the man that I had taken my checked in carry on luggage open a door to the outside of the walkway to the aircraft. I then saw him bring my bag out first and throw it down this 40 to 45 degree angled ramp. It went about 30 to 45 feet and bounced off of the railing at the bottom. Then he proceeded to throw approximately 13 to 15 more bags down on top of mine. As they slid down they literally bounced off of my small carry on luggage until the pressure was too much and they just simply stop bouncing and continued to press against my small luggage. When I arrived home, after my flight to Raleigh, NC and begin to unzip my bag, I immediately noticed that it had been significantly damage. This was a brand new SwissTech luggage I had just purchased for this trip. The way all of our bags were treated after we attempted to be supportive of the mission of your program is totally unacceptable and whomever is in charge of this part of your program should be ashamed. I will never provide you with the opportunity to treat my personal stuff in the manner in which you treated it this time. I am extremely upset and after paying over $1400 for tickets for me and my wife, it is extremely disheartening to find this is the best service you can provide. My rating below will reflect my disappointment with this part of your program/process in particular. It is not a reflection of other aspect of the services provided during the trip. I will recommend Delta Airlines to family and friends, however I will warn them not to go out of their way in any manner to accommodate a request from your company."
506,4,27,December,2021,Economy Class,Los Angeles , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  They blew my connection, then stuck me on a flight that next day that absolutely didn't work for any of my plans with no refund option. The flight I paid for was through Salt Lake City, and that was important to my plans. The flight they stuck me on went 2,000 miles out of the way to Minneapolis and then back to California. No explanation. No apology. No choices. Worst I've ever been treated by an airline in my life."

I went to baggage claim via wheel chair skycap, but only to learn that Delta finally brought my rollator to the gate. Not only was Delta too slow to have the rollator at gate, but customer service support was non existent at the gate to simply tell me to continue waiting at gate. Delta, please do better!"

509,2,20,December,2021,Economy Class,Eugene , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified , After 6 hours at the airport they canceled the flight and sent us to a hotel an hour away. Horribly rude staff and then gave us tacos for dinner which I had to pay half the bill because they said the drinks and only a certain dollar amount was allowed after we already eat. They say that we need to be at the airport at 7 am but they don't know if our plane will be able to fly so no departure time just wait till they can figure it out. I know it's the holiday but come on we have been patient we just want a little respect and for Delta to do the right thing. I ask everyone to stay away from Delta as they don't care what happens to you after they get your money.
510,1,19,December,2021,Economy Class,Phoenix , Pittsburgh , Detroit      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Terribly disorganized and unhelpful. I get that it's the holidays so everything is a bit crazy, but everything I dealt with could most definitely be handled better. The day before I left, I tried to check in for my connecting flight and it wouldn't let me. I had to sit on hold for about an hour (while at work mind you) trying to figure out what was wrong. I was very concerned as I knew no one in the state I'd be connecting flights with, and I'd have no way to get home for a while without getting on a new flight. The lady I spoke with said everything would be fine, I'd get my seat assigned at the gate. So the next day, I take my first flight, and go to connect to my second. I get to the gate and ask the lady behind the desk for my seat. She told me ""you're going to have to wait, we oversold this flight and I have to make sure you still have a seat"". I was very upset by this, as I had already explained that if I got stuck at that airport I would be there for a while. Eventually, she confirmed that I had a spot. I finish that flight, and go to the carousel to get my suitcase. I checked my app and it said my bag had been scanned and sent to that specific carousel ... but it wasn't there. I stood there waiting for about 45 minutes trying to find my bag. It never came up, so I went to the baggage office, where they initially tried to brush me off and said ""you just didn't wait long enough, you need to go back and look more"". This made me extremely irritated, as it was obvious they just wanted to get me out of their way, and they didn't really care that my bag was missing. Even when I explained that I had important medications in there, their attitudes did not change. Eventually, a very nice agent named Arthur helped me get a ""lost or mishandled claim"" filed, and he was probably the only helpful Delta associate I dealt with this trip. I am currently on hold with the airline, still trying to figure out my bag. I've been transferred twice and have had no communication on their end in over an hour and a half. I didnt really like Delta in the first place, but now I definitely will never be using their services ever again. It is so not worth the hassle, next time I'm just going to drive."
511,2,19,December,2021,Economy Class,Orlando , Sacramento        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Flight from Phoenix was fine other than the baby crying 75% of the time the whole. I decided to volunteer my carry on bag since it was a little bigger, and they needed the room. So no laptop or personal items i would have normally had with me. I get to Detroit at 5:30am, next flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to no crew. Then the flight updated around 9:40 to canceled. Next flight out wasn't until 1:45, no one can tell me where my bags are. I had to ask 2 different help desk. Other plans an reservation had to be canceled. And now stuck at the airport no phone charger, no laptop. Now have to spend more money on food that originally was not accounted for. I flew delta because American had something similar happen in Dallas. This experience was horrible, next time I'll drive."

513,2,18,December,2021,Economy Class,Rapid City , Buffalo       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  I bought a ticket for $2662 to be 5 hours delayed and not to forget we were just sitting inside the airplane with no complementary dinner or anything. They were distributing cups of water during this covid pandemic period stating that they don't have bottles of water. Of course they brought bottles of water after people complained about the water in cups not being sanitary or practical for the kids on board. I am irritated that i spent $2662 to be treated like this by Delta airline and something really needs to be done. If it was other regular flights they would have put more effort in it but since we are just a group of maybe 200-300 west Africans (Senegalese) we got treated very disrespectfully.  Its now 1230 am and we are sitting in the airplane still looking for a miracle.
514,1,16,December,2021,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Sacramento      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Absolutely horrible. Missed 2 flights because of a â€œminor maintenance issueâ€. Seats are very uncomfortable and crammed. If ever presented with a different airline, take it even if it adds another layover. Flying Delta wouldnâ€™t be worth it even if was free. Horrible aircraft, horrible customer service. It shocks me how little Delta cares for its customers."

519,2,13,December,2021,First Class,Seattle , Paris , Seattle      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," I thought Delta did a fantastic job during the course of our 13hr journey. The Flight Attendants were all extremely courteous and welcoming. We had two layovers and it was as comfortable as it could be sitting on a plane for 6 hour increments. We did hit a snag from Georgia to South Bend. Our layover was already 3h30m and the plane was delayed and hour but the gate agent decided not to inform any of us. So everyone sitting at the gate was just staring at each other wondering if there was a change. Luckily for us it was the last leg of the trip so we had time to spare. If others were connecting to other departures, it definitely would have been an issue. We did sit in Comfort plus which I believe was worth it for the long journey. They don't over meals but they do come around often with snacks and various beverages. They also had a pretty great app that's extremely user friendly and tracks your luggage if you decide to check in. I would consider strictly flying with Delta but may have to find another Carrier going to SBN. It seems their only route is through Georgia, and not only is the gate completely on the other side of the airport ( a good 40min walk) I was completely turned off by the lack of communication from their Gate Employee."
520,1,13,December,2021,Economy Class,Ft Wayne , Detroit , Seattle     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta never fails to impress but there were some glitches this time some not due to the airline and some did. Check in in Bogota was fast, too many questions were asked before being able to check in by security. Once provided with a boarding pass there was no line for Delta One customers so it took more than hour and a half standing. Lounges were closed due to covid but also by the time I had made it past security it was already almost time to board the plane. What made this flight memorable was the attention provided by the lead flight attendant which went out of her way to make me feel welcome. Unlike my previous flight also on Delta one as soon as upon entering she walked me to my seat and asked me is she could stow my jacket. A duvet, pillow, Tumi amenity kit, noise canceling phones and big water bottle were waiting on my seat. While taxing dinner orders were taken as well as drink choices and throughout the short 5 hour hop back to New York City many rounds of wine were provided. The meal was a veggie sandwich with hummus, some custard which was amazing, salad and wine. Later on I found out the same was offered on coach so this is where the airline lagged but to their defense meat wasnâ€™t allowed on flights by Colombian authorities due to the pandemic. Inflight entertainment was okay small selection on these older aircraft and my seat was comfy enough to sleep on. Bags arrived on time after landing."

(I had not actually cancelled my flight to Paris). After spending quite a long time (39 minutes) on hold I was connected with an agent. Shortly after connecting with the agent, my cell reception tanked. The agent stayed on the line with me for whole minutes - knowing that if we disconnected, I would be returned to the start of the queue. I am so grateful for this agent who persevered, waiting for me to move into better cell reception and complete my last minute cancellation. Thank you Delta. I like to fly with you already but this small nicety made a huge difference for me today. Thank you to the Delta agent for your grace, composure and patience."

It's always been my favorite, but the rude mask policy changed that for me. I have asthma and was struggling for breath, plus my mask kept sliding up into my eyes. I had it over my nose (completely covered) but apparently that wasn't high enough for the staff at the entry of the plane, who then tattled with text messages to the steward in the rear of the plane.

Delta advertises it is so easy to travel without worries, no change fees, can cancel and have eCredits. Well guess what? I bought a ticket for myself and an employee last July to travel next week and she no longer works for me, trip is cancelled. I have a credit for my ticket, hers has just vanished. Can't get satisfaction with chat, call in, wait time is 1 hour plus. I think its quite a racket to assure customers that there are guarantees then oops if you buy multiple tickets you only get a credit for the one in your name, over $800. Maybe someone could help me over the phone but who has an hour plus to wait to see if that is the person who is going to help. I've tried several times. I wonder how much money Delta pockets doing this to people. So dishonest. If I bought the ticket for an employee, who does not have a Delta account, who typically does not fly and then there is no credit that's like thievery. I have always flown Jet Blue but have started moving to Delta because JB doesn't have a first class but at least I've never had an experience like this."
524,10,8,December,2021,Economy Class,St Thomas , Atlanta        , Oklahoma City    ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,  I fly twice a month and Delta has been by far the worst airlines. They cancel connecting flights when your several states away from both home and destination. They do this for no other purpose but not having enough customers to make it worth their time fiscally. They will make you sleep on the airport floor just because. I am not flying to go on vacation but for family purposes and I do so in between my work which I am able to do remotely but it is to the point I will leave a negative review (which I have never done in my life). If itâ€™s the holidays or you have anything important to tend to donâ€™t risk it. Delta will be the first to pick the dollar over its customers. When I was in the air about to land they cancelled my connecting (again) and an hour later while talking to customer service my partner was still able to purchase a flight for this time slot which at a later time they told him it was delayed (by 656 minutes). Itâ€™s unethical business practices at the very least.

When I went to get back on the plane they told me my ticket wasnâ€™t valid anymore and then I had a new ticket booked for tomorrow even though my seat was still empty and I couldâ€™ve caught that flight. Went to customer service and they just gave me the run around. Then told me I could call on the black phones downstairs knowing that customer service is closed at this hour of the night."

We were assured multiple times that parties would be kept together, and asked not to check with gate attendant. Got separated from my family anyway, and while I get that it's tough to change anything with the plane already halfway full, it was frustrating to be separated at the end of a long day because of a mistake made by a company I paid for a service, and to get a very sorry-sucks-to-be-you attitude from the crew."

Now that I want to redeem my money they are saying they canâ€™t find any record of it and thereâ€™s nothing they can do. So I am out somewhere around $800. Customer service tried to find it, and then said I should have kept track of my flight number and info but I was never told that when I called in, I was just told I could redeem for another flight on a later date. If I had known this was a possibility for all of that money to get lost I would have just gotten a monetary refund. This makes me very distrustful of Delta. Delta lost my business."

Another passenger had the same problem! The gate agent was notified of the error and she came onto the plane being very rude and demanding; instead of apologizing! She placed my son and I on the very last seat of the plane instead of trying to correct their mistake! I always fly with Delta and I must say this was one of the rudest agents I have encountered! She covered up her badge when I told her I would report her. Thankful for the Delta Flight Attendant that moved us back to seat 19!"

I have been using Delta for years and this is easily my worst experience with any flight. Terrible customer service. Our entire return flight was cancelled and rescheduled for 24 hours earlier, cutting our vacation short by a day. We received no notification of this change and I only learned of it by confirming details because our trip was approaching. There was no flight available out of Alicante leaving and arriving on the days we originally booked. Delta offered no other options for helping us. I found a flight serviced by Delta out of Barcelona with days and times that were similar to our original booking. Even though we would lose money on train tickets and lodging, I suggested this. I was told I would have to pay the difference in fair and they would not offer an voucher, miles, or upgrade to compensate. The flights they offered out of Alicante were all overnight layovers in Amsterdam. I was told they would not provide a hotel voucher or any compensation for this solution either. This was an awful experience. Delta is going downhill."

Since we were booked out of ATL and I wasnâ€™t sure if she could return in time for our trip, I called trying to determine what alternatives we had. Changing her flight from San Francisco was unaffordable so I mentioned to the woman on the phone that that wouldnâ€™t work for us and I also remarked that I might end up cancelling it. She went ahead and cancelled it without my knowledge nor any indication that she was doing so while on the phone. I never received an email verifying that a change of any sort had been made. I found out two days before our scheduled flight, after we had gotten her back to Atlanta just to make this trip. We found out by trying to view our flight details. I called Delta immediately and they said I would have to pay a difference in airfare even though I never requested the change. The agent made it clear that I would not receive a refund despite the fact that there was a â€œmisunderstanding.â€ He also claimed that Delta does not record the conversations and therefore could not verify that this cancellation was not requested."

At first told us there was a delay due to having to get ice sprayed off and that we were about to push back, 20 minutes later and still no push back they decide to finally inform us that they have messed up the bags as well and that they are now having to manually count them for the plane ... this is causing the plane to leave almost an hour late and the flight attendants aren't even offering first class a drink or snack or anything to pass the time where we usually would have drinks and snacks and be in the air by now.

536,10,18,November,2021,Economy Class,Newark , Atlanta        , Paris CDG     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Delta cancelled my flight without any notice. I found out the day before my flight when I tried to check in and I couldn't. My latest email confirmed my itinerary so I assumed everything was fine.

537,2,15,November,2021,Economy Class,Los Angeles , San Francisco      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta used to be the best airline. While I was in the military I used to fly delta specifically because you could get to your destination faster if the flight ahead of you had seats or there was a more direct flight that had seats. Today as in right now I am on a flight to San Francisco to turn around and go to Boise. I board at gate B1 in SLC, at gate B5 there is a direct flight to Boise with 3 available seats in comfort. So not only would I have one less flight I would have given Delta more money for a seat they had open. I did this exact thing all the time for 9 years when they were green boarding tickets, this proves it is possible yet here I am doing something stupid that costs more money for delta."
538,3,15,November,2021,Economy Class,Austin , Turkey , Amsterdam      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," I took my first flight in 1974 with Delta and this is the first time I have been ripped off by them - and with such deception! I flew EWR DL x/ATL AF x/CDG AF MAD on November the 6th. I went to the check-in counter at Terminal B and the agent there asked me for $75 for my small carry-on. I told him I didn't pay that because I am Air France ""silver"" & I paid for the ticket with my Delta Air Skymiles Gold American Express card which allows me and my traveling companions one free checked suitcase. I took out the Gold card and showed it to him, and he punched a few things into his keyboard, and told me it was fine and handed me back my card. It wasn't until I was on my Air France flight from Atlanta to Paris that I saw that he'd hidden behind all of my boarding passes a charge slip for $75. If he was so stubbornly intent on charging me $75 despite my two mitigating credentials I would have carried my small suitcase aboard the flight - in fact at the gate at Newark the Delta representative (very professional in the way he handled my travel documents) offered to check all carry-on suitcases to the final destination free-of-charge. I don't understand why I was ripped off and so deceptively! (It was like something out of the Trump administration), and there they are ripping off their presumed best customers (I am now ""Gold Elite"" with Air France/KLM/Skyteam including Delta). I wrote to Delta customer relations nine days ago but not a word from them. I do not know if I should abandon my Gold American Express card in protest and go back to flying on the One World Carriers (Platinum/Sapphire status) - they occasionally rip me off too but not so brazenly. I am just disgusted by the whole issue. Otherwise, the flight on Delta was fine and went as expected (as the French say, it was ""correct.""). But what a sour taste in my mouth!"

Luckily we had money to buy return tickets the next day. We have been calling Delta for two days and didnâ€™t reach a mutual agreement, when you call prepare to stay on the line for a minimum of 60 minutes and if you are calling from overseas imagine the cost, the last representative was so rude.

Food was disgusting and rudely served. For tickets that are sold for between $9,000 to $12,000 roundtrip it was ridiculous. We wanted to complain to the Purser but she and most of the cabin crew were sleeping at the back of the almost empty economy class. The consensus among the passengers was never never fly Delta One. It is economy with flat beds and not worth the money.

The whole process was seamless. In contrast, the arrival ground service at JFK was horrible. Somehow Delta decided to disembark us at the deserted T2 instead of the normal T4. We waited nearly 30 minutes at a small baggage carousel, only to know later that our luggage came out from another one across the terminal. After rushing to the right carousel, as it was too small, we could not even come close to it. I saw our luggage but could not break through the crowd hogging the carousel to get them, and imagine it happened during the pandemic time that required some sort of social distancing. I booked the flight with anticipation to fly on the new Delta One ""Suite"" on board of the 767-400ER. However, Delta changed it to a 767-300ER with older, less spacious seats. Well, I don't complain as we still got flatbeds with direct aisle access. Food presentation was at pandemic standard, meaning worse than before. At least the food tasted fine and we were well fed. No complain here either."
544,5,9,November,2021,First Class,Orlando , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My wife is flying home and we switched her to a Same Day earlier flight. I tried calling, and Delta's hotline told me a 30 minute wait, or I could text with an agent. I texted with an agent. I asked him 3 times to confirm that my wife was on the earlier flight, asking him to double check the Confirmed status, the new arrival time, and again that her status was confirmed and NOT standby. He confirmed (in writing/texting) THREE separate times that she was Confirmed, not on Standby. Low and Behold, my wife gets to the airport and she is not confirmed - she is on Standby. I tried calling to talk with someone and their hotline gave me an error saying there were technical difficulties and then hangs up. So I text the number back and start everything over trying to talk to someone. The new agent responds to my text once every 5-10 minutes or so. She starts off by telling me there has been no change to my itinerary (as my wife has ALREADY caught the 1st earlier flight). Then when I point this out, she tells me (15 min later) that I should have reached out before my first flight and she can't change anything now. When I point out that I did reach out before my first flight, she (after another 5-10 minutes) then says that I'm 62nd on the standby list. When looking at Delta.com, I'm listed as 2nd. I point this out. Then (after another 10 minutes), she says that I an pay $75 to switch from standby to confirmed. I say do it. 10 minutes later, the door closes and they tell me the flight is full. I tell her so and she apologizes nd explain that she had to deal with other customers' inquiries. She then goes on to tell me that I really should have known better and that since I never paid the $75 fee, I shouldn't have expected to be on Confirmed. Despite what the first agent told me That's why I called in the first place - to figure out what I needed to do to be Confirmed! One of my worst experiences by far - your first agent literally lied to me so that he wouldn't have to help me, and your second agent took 10-15 minutes to respond to any text messages, after which (in less than 10 minute responses) then implied it was my fault for not knowing better. What an awful experience!"

So 5 of us were told we have been moved to a later flight. Our original flight was scheduled for take off at 3:30pm. And our new flight was scheduled for 4:15pm,. So we walked over to the other gate as instructed just to find out that our flight was delayed until 6:00pm. We had already been at the airport all morning so I was little irritated by then. However when it was time to board at 6:00pm, the plane sat there for 40 mins with no take off. I could hear the flight attendants say they have been working for more than 15 hours that day, so everyone was taken off the plane and by then we had missed out connecting flight home from Atlanta to Omaha. We had to wait until 12:30 AM for Staff from another plane to take everyone at that time from Orlando to Atlanta. I couldn't believe how long I was forced to sit at the airport just for a 1 hour flight. They didn't offer food or drinks to any of the passengers who missed dinner and were staving. Needless to say, we didn't arrive to Atlanta until 2:30 Am. But then we still had to catch a flight to Omaha. Delta made us walk from the airport to a hotel at 2:30 AM to Sleep for 3 hours and then we had to walk back to the airport so catch a flight at 8:00Am to Omaha. Not only that, but we got lost trying to find the hotel and its very scary to be walking around in that area that late. I will never fly with Delta again."

When I was leaving Calgary to head to Green Bay, my flight was cancelled last minute due to a system outage with Delta (700 flights cancelled in one day). I was put on another flight for the following day at the same time but needed to get to Green Bay the next day. I got on the phone as well as messaged their help text line and within an hour and a half an associate was able to get me on a new flight for the same day through a different airline for free. For my flight home, my Covid test to get back into Canada was 19 minutes too early so the Canadian boarder wouldnâ€™t let me on the plane. So the Delta associate at GRB (Christine) was able to book me on a new flight for 3 days later free of charge and ensured that if I got my new Covid test back earlier that I could get on the earliest flight out (also free of charge and if they had seats available). So I did end up getting my Covid test back a day earlier than my scheduled flight and went to the airport and Christine had me on the next flight out! It was such excellent service and the staff were so helpful and did everything they could to ensure I got to and from my destinations as soon as possible."

My friend is 78 years old and has no wish to use the internet, nor is he familiar with it. After the funeral another friend his age drove him to the airport with the deceased friend's cat in tow. When these two elderly gentlemen arrived at the airport there was nobody to man the desk at Delta. A member of the security staff directed them to another terminal where he had seen some attendants, but after a long trek with kitty in tow they returned to the Delta desk, having found nobody to help. A Delta employee then showed up and asked them if she could help. The plane was already boarded, and she held it so my friend could get his boarding pass, pay for the transport of the cat, and go home. She then rousted some employees from what must have been a break room and handed my friend off to two of them. These two employees were apparently unable to work the Delta computer system, and after a number of attempts the flight left, stranding my friend and cat in Spokane for the night with all the costs that entails. When my friend voiced just how upset he was, without threatening anybody, he was threatened with removal by security. He did eventually get his flight changed to the next day, and was able to make his way home. What a terrible way to treat an elderly gentleman who has just had a very painful loss! I felt simply awful to have gotten him into this predicament by booking a flight with Delta. Delta? Never again!"

Also their contactless payment credit card app did not work. I will fly Delta any day of the week. Jeffrey was awesome and it is amazing on how one flight attendant can have such an impact on your perception of the whole airline. Airlines should take notice of how important flight attendants, such as Jeffrey are to the entire customer experience and recognize their efforts appropriately. Delta is now our preferred airline because of him!"

Awful time and layover after we paid for direct flight, would never do business with them again, much better options out there! 0/10 - not the first time they disappointed but will be the last for this family."
556,9,28,October,2021,Economy Class,Chicago , Los Angeles , Minneapolis     ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  We upgraded our seats from economy to comfort plus for around $400 per seat. The seats were tight and the plane was a bit aged. Definitely not worth the extra money. We were able to board sooner which means we got overhead storage. The leg room was maybe 2-3 inches more but the seat width was narrow. Also, the arm against the window doesn't go up which dug into my leg the entire flight. Either go economy and save your money or pay for first class. This plane (DL427) should not be used for a 10 hour flight. Time for this plane to be refurbished or placed on shorter routes."
557,5,26,October,2021,Business Class,"Oklahoma City, OK "," Bismarck, ND     ",Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  They moved the departure time up, loaded us all on the plane then said we are delayed due to weather. We have a plan B but will wait another 30 minutes to see if it clears up. It was obvious it was not going to get better. After 30 minutes we were told we are going with plan B just waiting to get more fuel. We took off nearly an hour late and flew a different route which took longer. We arrived in SLC 10 minutes after our connecting and last flight for the day to San Diego. We were told to go to the Delta help desk. While waiting in line we here a team member tell the two ladies in front of us that he will provide them with hotel rooms an upgrade to comfort plus. When we go to the next available service rep and ask about accommodations she says, â€œwe donâ€™t do that for weather eventsâ€. I have two issues with this. 1. This was initially a weather event, but waiting for 30 minutes before requesting fuel for a plan B that was that everyone knew would have to happen is what caused us to miss the flight. 2. If â€œwe donâ€™t do that for weather eventsâ€ why did one service rep do it for at least two different groups? So we spent the night in the airport and when we got on the plane our group of 4 who paid extra for each ticket so we could be together was placed all over the place. Not one of us was with another. Very unhappy about this situation."

I did not do anything wrong, the previous flight from Chicago to Minneapolis was delayed but I was assured that I will be able to make my flight. We did make the flight but it was boarding. The attendant angrily told me that my seat was given away because of the delay. However, after I was forced to take this seat, at least 8 other people came on board and I noticed at least 2 who still got choice seats in my section. I was offered a middle seat which caused me distress and pain and injury to my shoulder. I had surgery recently and needed my shoulders to be free and also have another medical diagnosis that requires me to seat in aisle seat. I am very disappointed."

I booked a bereavement fare. I arrived at the airport at 4.45 am to learn my flight had been canceled and I had been automatically rebooked for the next day. I literally would have missed the funeral the next day. With the bereavement fare, they had all the specific information of the funeral I had to attend. So if they cared at all, they would have seen it was a bereavement fare and looked at the details to see the flight the next day would have served no purpose. They did nothing, with no regret, to help. They pretty much just told me I was out of luck."

562,4,19,October,2021,Economy Class,Sacramento , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," My family and I booked a trip to visit my grandma. On the way home I had the worst flight experience I'd ever had. We had just landed in Salt Lake and our plane to Minneapolis was already boarding. I was 7 and a half months pregnant running to the gate. I had to use the restroom so bad and I was having horrible pain. When we were almost to the gate we realized that for some reason I had been placed on a separate flight from the rest of my family. So that I did not have to be alone while this far along and in pain my dad, in front of the two gate employees gave me his boarding pass. This caused a lot of problems and delayed the flight. Everyone was talking about me and I was having a panic attack. The captain tried to convince me to get off the plane and made me feel bad for having him rewrite my ticket. The plane ride was bumpy, I was in pain and I was having a horrible panic attack. After being in the air for awhile I calmed down and was able to relax. To top it off as I was leaving the flight, the flight attendants rudely mentioned, as they were right next to me that someone who was not supposed to be there delayed the flight. Even though I was originally on a different flight, Delta never apologized for isolating a 7 and a half month pregnant woman from her babies father and the rest of her family for no reason. Did nothing to make me feel better. And everyone was extremely rude. I don't understand this and I will not be flying with Delta again. The worst flying experience I have ever."

Over and over. A few days later I finally get someone via text, they help me cancel my and my boyfriends flight. They gave us both ecredit. We checked that we received the ecredit, all good! Two weeks later? His still shows up, but mine now says $0. They just took away over $200 of credit!? Iâ€™ve tried on the app, Iâ€™ve tried on my computer, nothing. And now I have to spend hours waiting, calling, texting to hopefully get it sorted. How is this a professional company! I honestly will never fly them again after this. Especially not after all the time spent trying to contact them way ahead of our trip. Itâ€™s irresponsible. Zero loyalty to their customers."

No internet and they even sold us the headsets to watch movies or music on the flight! Delta never again!"
565,1,19,October,2021,First Class,Northwest Arkansas , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  If I could give this airline a negative score then I would do so immediately. Hands down the worst airline in existence and should be ashamed to even call themselves an airline. Despite registering my flight 4 months in advance, they changed my flight plan 6 times without my permission. They just sent me an email saying that it is changed and didn't do anything about it. I tried calling customer service to get my original flight plan back after each time it was changed, but they put my on hold for 6 hours and never picked up. I'm surprised they didn't change my flight time the day of the flight, because they changed it 3 days before. My original flight plan was supposed to last 9 hours from Portland to Boston. It turned out to be a 16 hour flight due to the changed flight schedule and layovers. I spent over $700 for a flight without many layovers and they change it to a flight that's probably worth $400 max."
566,1,18,October,2021,Economy Class,Beirut , New York       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," The â€œCovid excuseâ€ is getting old. This once great airline has devolved into a low service carrier. A nearly 6 hour flight and a drink was served in a plastic cup and the â€˜mealâ€, the â€œlunchâ€ was a choice of three things in a box. I have been on many flights of varying lengths lately and this â€œ offeringâ€ is the sorriest excuse I have experienced yet. The website says lunch would be served and I ended up with a tiny salad in a box. The scene inside terminal two at LAX resembled a third world terminal in its chaos and dis order. The entire experience was pathetic and unsettling."

They tried to tell me my vaccination in April didn't qualify because the most it could be was 12 months. What? Then, our plane in Atlanta that had sat there all day when maintenance could have been performed was deemed to be unworthy to fly. They waited 5 hours for another plane and wouldnâ€™t help us transfer to other flights. They did â€œrebookâ€ our adjoining flights we were missing. Then, when we got to that flight, we were not booked. We ended up with 12 more hours of 2 more flights and missed the entire first daysâ€™ events. I hope I never have to fly Delta again. Their incompetence is horrible. I usually fly United. Now I know why."

I arrived to JFK Queens NY and both of my check-in luggage were missing. Eventually, one arrived a few days later (I have no idea how it ended up in London) and the other one is lost or stolen. Its now October 14 and Delta decided to give me $380 ONLY. It had clothes gifts shoes handbags worth more than this. Never again. My friend even told me you should've never flown with Delta, they're known to lose bags. Should have listened."

On the way back from Miami was a whole other experience!!! So many people either with no mask on or not on correctly. People on their phones stressed.

570,4,12,October,2021,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Redmond      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We booked a four day vacation do Denver, from Michigan, through Expedia.com. The flight there was with Frontier, we were not impressed. We were charged for checked luggage at the airport which we did not have; they refused to help us, the only way was to pay an additional $141, then we couldn't sit next to each other. On the way back from Denver, the flight was full with Delta. We had to get our seat assignment at the gate, and when we did the women told us that we could not sit together, yet again on this trip. One we boarded the aircraft, I asked a flight attendant if he could assist us. Once we were in the air, Blair was able to accommodate us, we not only got to finish our vacation sitting next to each other but he also hooked us up with some complimentary drinks and apologized for our bad experience."

572,4,10,October,2021,Economy Class,Seattle , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," Delta is always a poor experience, no seat assignment until you get to the gate and then once you get to the gate the staff are completely rude, and offensive. I fly thousands of miles every year normally on United where the service is so much better I avoid Delta whenever possible and today I am reminded again why. Who likes to be treated with disdain and an inconvenience. Apparently the Delta staff have forgotten that I pay for their rent every time I purchase a ticket. You would so well to train your staff to practice the art of kindness when dealing with your customers. Iâ€™d rather fly indirect than fly Delta direct itâ€™s awful experience every time."
573,1,7,October,2021,Economy Class,Detroit , Hawaii , Detroit      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," I purchased tickets through Alitalia for the Alitalia/Delta partnership with economy ticket seats for travel between Boston and New York JFK and premium ticket seats for the transatlantic flights between New York and Rome Italy. The transatlantic flights were to be on Alitalia, however on September 1 with a hurricane approaching the northeast coast forced a closure of JFK NY airport. As a result Delta offered an alternative flight from Boston to Amsterdam and then to my final destination, Rome. This avoided New York and the hurricane altogether. I thought my departure and arrival problems were resolved until: 1) Although I paid for a premium transatlantic seat, I was given an economy seat. I specifically asked the attendant at the boarding gate to confirm that I had a premium seat. He said I did which was not true and I discovered this after I boarded the plane. Therefore, I can only conclude that the individual at the desk either outright lied or was completely incompetent. Either way he did not care one bit about the customer. 2) Delta delayed my luggage. I arrived in Rome on Thursday. I did not receive my luggage until the following Monday. 3) I tried to get a partial reimbursement from Delta for the cost difference between the economy seat and the premium seat. They have told me that although they were the ones who made the mistake, they could not provide a partial refund and that I would need to go through Alitalia. To date Delta has not provided any assistance in obtaining my partial refund. In fact they have only wasted my time with numerous phone calls with very lengthy waiting time on the phone. Lastly, it took them more then a week to get back to me and tell me that Delta could not help and that I must go through Alitalia. The representative on the phone chose to argue with me rather than help. I was neither rude nor aggressive on the phone since I know that would not have helped. I am still waiting to hear back from Delta or Alitalia. No refund yet. At present I will choose not to fly Delta and that will hold true for Alitalia since they are going out of business in the near future. To be continued."
574,1,6,October,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , Charlotte        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  How does it make any sense for Delta to switch seats that you have chosen in advance and put some random person between you and your family members. How could you possibly know if that person you are putting next to us is ill or carrying a virus. Three of us flying together and they moved all of us in different seats away from each other to sit next to strangers. Way to control COVID Delta.
575,7,5,October,2021,Economy Class,New Orleans , Kansas City      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Last two times I have booked with Delta my flight has either been cancelled forcing me to go with much more expensive option or cancelled and changed out with much less desirable flight. I went from having a roundtrip non-stop flight to having stops both ways and about 8 hours added to my trip. When I tried to get assistance for this their response was pretty much too bad, its out of our control. Mind you they have non-stop flights for those exact dates with only like 2 hour difference, but they decided to give a much less desirable flight and all they could offer me was changing to a non-stop flight 3 days later for an extra $100. Never flying Delta again."
576,8,4,October,2021,First Class,Chattanooga , Little Rock       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I will never fly through Delta again. Nor will I use Detroit Metro Airport to fly. We missed our flight back from Hawaii to Michigan. Our baggage stayed on that flight. It arrived at 7am in the morning and they put it in an office for us. We took another flight back, got in at 1p. We came to pick up both of our suitcases (2 of them), and 1 of them were not there. They have no clue what happened to it. They tells use only 3 people have access to where the bags were that day. Not a single one of them know what happened to the bag. They tell us there are no cameras. They tell us there is nothing they can do for us.  Jackie at Detroit metro airport Delta lost baggage was helpful. But she was also useless. She literally told me at one point that it's possible it grew legs and walked out because no one here would steal it.  We filed a claim. We filed a police report. Nothing. No one is helpful. They just give false possibilities."

We booked 1st Class in Advance, and not only was the flight delayed, then we got moved to the back because a flight attendant needed the seat and we did not get a refund.

578,1,3,October,2021,Economy Class,Athens , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Scheduled our flight over a month ago. At no point would it let us pick our seats (like they said we could) the night before the flight we check our app and I am located at the very front of the plane and my husband is located at the very back of the plane, even though the tickets were bought at the same time. We called the customer service twice where ones we were hung up on out of nowhere in the middle of our call, and the second being told there was nothing they could do. Unless we paid close to $100 per option. We could pay almost $100 extra a piece to sit together or pay almost $100 a piece to cancel. They said we could have a flight credit but have to pay the cancellation fees. What is the point in the credit it were paying more total for the cancellation. Or what was the point in buying tickets together. We will NOT be flying again. To be a ""high end"" air service we have been treated very unprofessionally."
579,1,28,September,2021,Economy Class,Cancun , Salt lake city      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  I will never fly with Delta again. A few months back I lost my car and house keys in TSA. I called back to verify that I left them in TSA and was told they had them. After my trip I went home and they couldnâ€™t find my keys. I had to pay $300 for a new key for them to call me back the next day and tell me they had them which I already knew. Now this month I book a flight with them and they kept delaying it. I ended up booking with a new airline because I had already missed a day a work due to there delays and didnâ€™t get a chance to cancel the flight due to the person at the desk telling me I needed to call customer service. 10 days have passed and Iâ€™ve called customer service and now my ticket isnâ€™t available to be an e ticket or voucher. So I am completely done with Delta.

This time they donâ€™t have a pilot. Itâ€™s made me miss my appointments every time which will result in losing my job. The last time I had two delayed flights in the same day. (Different aircraft) They no longer have the reputation of being the on time airline. I definitely will be closing my sky miles card and be seeking another airline to use in the future. I simply cannot afford to fly Delta.

Rumor has it that if the plane is not full they will cancel no matter the airline. If this is the case then stop booking morning flights. I see my daughter a couple times a year so an afternoon down the drain because of a canceled flight is a big deal. Then you call and the airlines dont want to help, They say they have no control, they do not offer refunds, they only give excuses that you can have a later flight or next day flight which may get canceled too. I pay good money to have her fly home and for me to fly out there and I am tired of this happening every time and no one cares. Half the time you cannot even get a person on the phone itâ€™s just a robot!!"

584,1,26,September,2021,Economy Class,Pittsburgh , San Diego , Atlanta     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  The flight to Nassau was perfect as was the return flight to Atlanta where I live. We fly Delta always! Have been Delta Platinum card members for years! We used to not care if another airline was a little more expensive because we are loyal Frequent Flyers. We are learning this means little to nothing to Delta. We had a flight to Cabo San Lucas non stop, round trip in Delta comfort that was cancelled by the airline and replaced with a very inconvenient and lengthy route and main cabin seats. The flights we had scheduled to fly originally had not been cancelled they simply moved us and down graded cabin to the other flights! We were to fly home from Cabo to Salt Lake City for a five hour layover and leaving at midnight to Atlanta arriving at 5am. This is wrong. So they refunded us for the difference in airfare after we called them on it and returned us to our original return flight. Months ago I made round trip Delta Comfort (first class was full) flights to Rome ahead of our cruise in Europe next May. Today we noticed that the reservations are no more in our â€œMy Tripsâ€. And of course you canâ€™t talk with a human being any longer. So we can no longer be assured that a reservation on Delta will be honored."
585,1,26,September,2021,Economy Class,San Diego , Traverse City , Minneapolis    ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  We flew from Koa, Hawaii to San Jose, California and it took almost 11 hours. It seemed like we passed SFO and than made our way to Washington with a 1 hour layover. That added 5 hours to our travel time and seemed unnecessary to not stop in San Jose first. We flew American Airlines to Hawaii and Delta on the way home, comparing the 2 AMERICAN was way more comfortable seating with more leg room and their flight attendants were really friendly and genuinely excited to take you to Hawaii. Delta was a different feel the flight attendants didn't really seem to want to be there, they offered drinks 1 time on a 5 hour flight and the seating was very uncomfortable. Our knees were almost touching the seats in front of us. There were TVs on each rest for our long flight from Hawaii but not from Washington to San Jose. That was a smaller plane and you felt turbulence a lot more in the smaller plane. Wifi did not work for texting either flight. I understand over the ocean it doesnâ€™t work but it didnâ€™t work over the mountains either. Honestly I donâ€™t think we will fly Delta anymore regardless of price. They did do a good job helping my grandma in a wheel chair and I appreciate that. Btw their prices change the more you look at the ticket prices. For whatever reason it was different pricing for each of us depending on if I looked on my phone again or on a tablet like I was a whole new person."

I asked if they were going to guarantee my laptop, camera equipment and my Bose headphones. Total of about 5k worth of equipment. The lady at the counter rudely said we guarantee nothing but I was free to carry the contents of the bag without the bag. We get on the plane finally and there's several empty over head bins. 2 minutes before we leave a Delta employee takes the seat next to me and of course he has not one but 2 full size carry on bags. I've been a sky miles member for a few years but you can keep the miles. I'll not be giving you any more of my business."

Their app will increase the price of the ticket if you look at it more than once (each time you look for an option and don't buy immediately - it will double the price by the hour). Its so evident, they should be ashamed to abuse their own potential clients. The app will always tell you that there is only one or two tickets left, to pressure you into paying ridiculously high rates. Then, when you board the plane, its half empty. Please avoid being robbed by Delta."

During my 7.5 hour flight from Atlanta to Anchorage the WiFi was not working and the TV was not working. When I brought this to the attention of the flight attendant she acted like I was an inconvenience. She was also very rude to the other passengers as well. I am currently sitting in the Anchorage airport waiting to return to Orlando and they are not staffed at the check in desk. I have 10 other passengers with me currently. They do not have a phone number provided to call for service. The other airlines near by say that the Delta employees commonly do not pay attention to there check in desks. Before booking my flight I received the delta airlines credit card thinking I will continue using this company. I will be closing my credit account and I suggest everyone pay extra to use a different airline.
591,3,20,September,2021,Premium Economy,St Louis ," Manchester, UK      ",Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Nice experience. There was slight delay due to a mechanical problem. The captain personally announced in the waiting area that there would be a slight delay due to a mechanical problem. When the problem was fixed, he announced that the problem was repaired and assured us that the aircraft was ready to fly. So nice to hear these announcements from the captain. Usually the gate agents make these announcements. The snack service consisted of a box of crackers, cheese and sweets. Nothing to brag about, but understandable due to covid."

Seats comfortable with enough legroom for me. (I'm 6' 2"") Both segments were on time and my luggage arrived with me. Flight attendants were alright.

Because of that we elected to pay the xtra money & fly 1st class. Come travel day we get on plane & we were Surprised to say the least. We paid over $1800 a little wider seat and extra 2 inches of leg room. Now on to the flight which was fine except previously mentioned items. We requested a wheelchair at every stop. At Salt Lake NO help at gate. Finally got someone to push & thank god as we had 38 minutes to get all way across the airport. That whole experience at SLC was brutal. Due construction we had to climb up & down to get to bus to take us to plane. And we had no help getting to car rental once In Omaha.

I arrived at 4.45 am, my plane was supposed to leave at 5.45 am, there was a delay because they had to repair the breaks on the plane. The flight was supposed to take off at 9.00 am, but I was notified again that the flight would be delayed. My flight was delayed 6 times, at one point I went to the desk to see what the problem was and I was given a $15 voucher for food. The second time I went to the desk I was told I was going to be on the next flight, not only was I not on that flight but I was told that flight was full. I called customer service and spoke to someone there and the person I spoke to tried to tell me they didnâ€™t see a delay, I was very angry at this point and called the person a liar because I had 6 emails from them telling me my flight had been delayed 6 times. I was in that airport in Knoxville for nine hours, from 4.45 am to 2.00 pm and not once did I feel like myself or some of the other passengers who were also delayed were a priority. Their resolution was a $100 voucher, as if my experience makes me want to fly Delta ever again. Voucher or not. Never again!"

The state of their customer service is abysmal, and the last 3 flights I've had with them have all had delays and one even cancelled. They offer no support for getting updated covid tests if you are travelling overseas as well. I just had to spend almost $100 on ubers in a layover city to get a test because of these delays, and they refuse to reimburse me for that. Also while I was typing this they just announced another delay on a rescheduled flight from 24 hours ago."

We sprinted across the airport to catch the next flight to ICT. We arrived 1 minute after the gate closed and they refused to let us on. They had to put us up in two rooms and pay for our drinks and meals. How much does that cost them? A lot more than opening the door when the plane hadnâ€™t even moved. Thatâ€™s okay they donâ€™t care if they go bankrupt we (the government) will always bail them out. Maybe if our weak government quits bailing them out they would have better service and run their business better - utterly ridiculous!

We boarded on time and then sit there leaving the airport 15 minutes later that the posted time of 6:55 pm. We landed in Atlanta at 8:07 on time at then sit on the tarmac for 20 minutes before pulling up to terminal A28. We raced to the front of the plane as they took their sweet time opening the door. Itâ€™s now 8:30 our plane is scheduled to depart from gate D6. We ran to gate D6 arriving at the gate at 8:40. The monitor said CLOSED. The agent would not even try to get us on the plane as it was still sitting there with the walkway still up to the planes door. These staff are rude and could careless about their customers.

JAC-MSP delay was caused by waiting for a fuel truck. MSP-LGA was due to change in flight plan. LGA-ROC because we were stuck on the tarmac for 45 minutes. All segments were full. Flight crews were okay. I can't really complain or rave. Pro Tip: The first row of Delta's Comfort Plus on their domestic Airbus and Embraer E-175 aircraft have more legroom that their domestic first class seats. IFE was okay, I forgot to bring my headphones but that's okay. I did not use their Wi-Fi. The on board flight tracker kept me amused along with their BlackJack game app. Overall impression: Not great, but not awful either. Delays not Delta's fault."

As we were boarding they say they are out of space for carry on and we had to check our bags. Both ways. To Columbus and home. When we got on the plane there was plenty of open bins. They weren't full at all. Horrible service didn't even care. Just kept saying sorry. Checked bags they don't care about your stuff. It is just thrown around. We paid extra to be in main cabin and we are the ones who had to check our bags. The ones who didn't pay extra didn't have to check their bags. I am very upset about this and will never fly Delta again if I can help it. They used the covid excuse. Had nothing to do with covid. The way they board is ridiculous and does not help you avoid covid.

Every time i call itâ€™s 50 mins till someone picks up. 2 times Iâ€™ve waited 1 hour plus just to have them pick up and hang up. For my flight back to the USA I called and waited 1 hour and 23 mins till someone picked up. They said they made the changes to my flight (add my known traveler number/join flights to show traveling together) and they didnâ€™t. They hung up in mid conversation and I got no call back to continue confirming and finishing my changes. When I got to the airport and none of the changes were made. I landed at my connecting airport and customs is taking forever and when I called customer service to try and get ahead and be pro active to see what me and my family can do if we are delayed from customs too much and are late for our connecting flight, get told wait time is 2 hours.  Terrible airline, will avoid Delta from now on. Donâ€™t bother having customer service if you donâ€™t A. Pick up the phone and B. Donâ€™t even make the changes or help when you do."

Delta doing their usual switch planes, times, itineraries, updates us to next plane change in first class. My son, who has the same last name, gets a 3 hour layover in Atlanta and booked on another flight in comf+. I just happened to be looking at our itineraries online to make transportation arrangements on the ground & saw this. No call to ask would he like to pay xtra to remain on the same flight or put in coach for the same priceâ€¦nope, weâ€™ll just separate the family & screw up my birthday dinner reservations on the ground. Forget about the time I took meticulously booking him online myself in order to avoid the ungodly wait time of having a delta agent help me. Forget about the fact that Delta left him Atlanta in April this year knowing full well he was expected. Forget about the fact that we spent 4 hrs driving him bk & forth to Orlando so he could have less plane changes (more direct flight) to have Delta change his return trip & add another stop when I could have booked him myself directly from Melbourne & had the same amount of stops and heâ€™d be home instead of us losing 4 more hours of our lives driving back and forth to a diff airport for no reason now. I paid xtra for comf+ but it would be an even trade to get him in coach (row 32) in a middle seat because thatâ€™s all they have available. So much for being a loyal Delta flyer for 30 years! Customer service is a joke since the pandemic. Very unhappy."
604,6,10,September,2021,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Portland      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Terrible experience with Delta! We were given $200 gift certificates to fly Delta for our honeymoon. Booked our flights a couple of months in advance. Just a couple of weeks before departure, Delta changed our return flight from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. This didn't work for us. I was on hold with Delta for over 7 hours. When I finally spoke with a representative - she said she would refund our return flights and keep our departure flights. The gift cards would be applied to the departure flights. So she cancelled our flight but couldn't get the refund to process. I was transferred to a different representative where I sat on hold for an additional 5 hours! That representative told me that he couldn't process a refund he'd have to keep our departure flights and refund our gift cards - applying them to our departure flight wasn't an option unless they cancelled both flights and then rebooked the departure flight. I asked how long it would take and he assured me that it would be within 7 days. We are long past 7 days ... we have no refund, no departure flight and flights have now more than doubled in cost! We called Delta today who told us that it could actually take us up to 30 days to see our refund - which is after our trip, and that they would not honor the original ticket pricing and that we'd now have to pay more than double for our departure flight. Not to mention we'd paid a couple hundred dollars extra for a different return flight with another airline at such late notice. So we're literally out thousands of dollars - do not have a flight to our honeymoon in a couple of weeks and Delta won't do anything."

It was our first time using Delta. I was very impressed. My sister required a wheelchair at each airport and I have to say the service provided her was over the top. Every associate assigned to help us navigate to our connections were so friendly and kind. I most likely will use Delta as my primary flight now. Thank you Delta for employing people who knows that compassion matters.

One told me I need to be more responsible to make sure my first name on my passport matches my first name on my ticket! My flight from Atlanta to Lagos was originally scheduled for 4.25pm but as at 8.25pm we were still at the departure lounge. The airline did not offer any apology or deem it fit to offer refreshments to intending passengers. The ground staff are rude, and lack professionalism as they bark out answers when asked on the flight status."
607,4,9,September,2021,Economy Class,Orlando , St. Louis       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Worst airline ever. First they changed our plane without asking us so we had to change it back. Because they changed our plane without permission our bags were sent somewhere else. They are saying it might be up to 6 days before our luggage is mailed if it even makes it that far. Stuck in Brazil with nothing.
608,10,9,September,2021,Economy Class,Tampa , Chattanooga        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Delta has consistently changed flight schedules last minute and delayed flights more than any other airline. It has come to the point where I give myself a 12-hour schedule flexibility in order to accommodate Deltaâ€™s reputation with shifting schedules. The worst part about it is that they do it on purpose because they way overbook and do other low quality tactics to save their business money while putting passenger satisfaction last. Did I mention that their WiFi NEVER works? I donâ€™t even try anymore. It has worked literally 0% of the time with a sample size of about 8 flights I remember. Try your hardest to fly anyone else.

We have been waiting over an hour to take off. We are closed in on this ridiculously small aircraft during a pandemic.

610,3,8,September,2021,Economy Class,Kansas City , Charleston       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Delta took $385 out of my bank account without my consent. When I tried to solve this with the company the staff were rude and refused my refund! The customer care advisor was not helpful at all. She did not listen to my story where Delta has committed fraud on my card by swiping it without my permission. Delta staff are writing notes and making up baggage fees that I did not incur. I would advise you not to travel with Delta.

Then we get ready to come back and with Delta. They took $1,178 twice out of my account for first class. Then the tickets did not change and I paid 31.98 for comfort seats. Well you guys got $2435 for two people to go from MCO to STL to ride in seats 32 A&B. How is that possible. I will never fly Delta again."

Iâ€™ve flown four times in the last week and all but one of those flights were on time, the rest were 3+ hours delayed, I didnâ€™t get home until 3am one time for my 9pm flight. There is absolutely no reason for there not to be a pilot or crew to fly these planes, youâ€™re able to offer these flights so maybe you should staff them accordingly. Iâ€™ll never fly with Delta again after my experience with this crappy, ill-staffed airline- not worth the time or money spent. Frontier is even superior."

We got word last night at our layover in Atlanta that the cleaning crew had not cleaned the plane. So we wait and wait. When they finally showed up, the pilot and crew left the airport because they had Timed out. Whatever that means. We ended up staying the night in Atlanta and were supposed to be on the 6 am flight to Charleston. Well guess what, no co-pilot. So as of this moment in time we are stuck at this airport waiting to get a flight to Charleston because some copilot canâ€™t show up to work. Way to go delta!

My husband has been attempting to fly home for hours his flight has been delayed in atl multiple times with no explanation as to why. He has been rushed on and off the plane multiple times, just to be told the flight is delayed again and again. They will not allow him to have his carry on bag back that was put under the plane. So now he doesn't have access to his personal items or phone chargers. Thank goodness other individuals were kind enough to let them use their phones to keep me updated after his phone died. He was finally told that he wasn't going to leave at all tonight and hopefully he will be flying out first thing in the morning. Which at this point I don't know if we can belive that either. Delta is clearly not a superior carrier than American, or southwest. We will never refer any family or friends, nor spend another cent with delta."

I was given an options and I chose a virtual visa card which was to be issued by Black Hawk. I've been dealing with Delta and Black Hawk. Delta said they cannot do anything on their end once they issued the voucher for $600. Grew Hawk said they have received nothing. Dealing with two big companies, not one will take ownership!

621,1,2,September,2021,Economy Class,Hartford , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Salt Lake City to Cancun. Very disappointed. The first class seats are advertised as beds, but as a seat they are no bigger than coach. Truly. When I arrived at our seats we were shocked. We asked the attendant where is first class? We sat down in our coach size seats and I asked, where is my pillow and blanket? The attendant says we don't have any. Then we were offered the choice of two sandwiches for a 4+ hour flight. I don't eat sandwiches. I expected to get service like American at least and be offered a cheese plate, but no, that was it, an Italian sandwich. No drink service any more in first class I guess. I asked for a drink and was told ""not until we are in the air and the food service starts"". I have three trips coming up. Unfortunately, Delta is a hub in SLC. American is not much better, but I would rather connect than fly Delta ever again."

The bus was late from the parking deck and the line was as enormous due to the holiday the manager was not willing to even listen to us instead basically said it was nothing you can do either reschedule or leave another day. I asked if the luggage can just be placed on the next plane she refused, we asked if we can check it once boarding a plane that was denied as well. She was rude and uncalled for, we had to push our check in back another day leaving remaining family stranded in LA without a place to go. I will never fly Delta again."
623,1,30,August,2021,Economy Class,Detroit , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Always fly first class for both personal and business, for comfort and service. The attendants were rude, non accommodating, no wine. No champagne, nothing, did not tend to passengers, constant flow of passengers from coach using first class toilet. The foul smell of toilet usage was overwhelming, bathrooms filthy. Constant flow of people with attendants not redirecting the usage. When you fly first class you expect just that, I understand the high ticket price and more than willing to pay but expect first class service. As a result, I will never fly Delta for either person so it business flights. By the way, I sent my dissatisfaction at the time, never received a response from Delta."

625,1,28,August,2021,Business Class,Syracuse , Reno        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  On August 15 at 5.30 am I arrived at the Newark airport, it was 8.30 am and still waiting in line to deliver my luggage, it was when the Ddelta airlines staff reported that the 8.30 am flight closed the doors in addition to the other flights. They had 3 operators receiving around 200 people. It was at 8.30 am when one of the operators came up with the great idea of â€‹â€‹moving the people who had left the flight out of the line. Very quietly they asked me to return the next day, I refused because the next day I had a flight connection to another city to have my final destination. It was then that the Delta Airlines operator offered me a flight at 1.30 pm but I had to take a taxi to JFK Airport ($ 80 from my packet). Until then I thought, well, we are human beings and we make mistakes. It was then on my return from Cali Colombia when I was checking my luggage and the operator tells me that my carry-on bag does not meet the requirements on the aircraft. I brought carry-on from NY to Cali in hand but my carry-on bag could no longer return in the same way so the operator said he was holding it for me and I had to pay $120 dollars (they charged me $ 127 dollars). But Delta Airlines was not happy enough with the damage that occurred so far, when I arrived in Bogota, a stopover place, I took the opportunity to buy two bottles of liquor which were delivered to me on the plane, sealed in plastic bags, the plane had a delay of 2 hours and a half in Bogota because they had not put fuel, they had to wait for the takeoff authorization signature and this together took about three hours. My next stop was Atlanta , where a Delta operator received us shouting and I think he was going to hit us, trying to hurry us without the right to ask anything. Immigration passed, then the scan part, and that was when an officer told me that I could not take my two bottles of liquor, because they did not fit in the scanner and He threw them in the garbage"". as simple as that."

I did not choose this route, Delta cancelled the direct flights after I hade made the booking. Ok, there is a lot of paperwork and checking necessary at this time. I arrived at the airport in the time specified, only to find very few agents manning the booths, there was a long line at the Sky Priority desk, I'm quite sure 99% were not Sky Priority. After about a 30 minute wait, the line had hardly moved. At this point, I decided to jump the queue, as I am a Sky Priority passenger and was served as next in line (I normally do not do this). The same thing happened at Schiphol - at one point, there was only one person checking the paperwork for a full flight to the US, I suppose 300/400 people. I got through this line a little quicker, as I had left the lounge a lot earlier than I would normally do. Airlines pride themselves on Customer Service, well Customer Service starts as soon as you enter the airport. I have flown a lot over the years, mainly on Delta and their partner airlines, so I know what service should look like. Cabin service was ok, not particularly good. I am 86 and my wife is 84 and we select our routes, carefully with plenty of layover time, so we can have hassle free experiences. The ground experience was not one of those trips. The outgoing legs worked just fine."

She urged us to come to the counter to check bags, so my wife went to check a bag. Little did we know that she would be forced to get on board. She had left a personal bag with me thinking we would board later together. Now I had three bags, one of which were hers. Upon trying to board (after a surprise text from my wife), I was told I had to either consolidate or check a bag. I was threatened that I would not be able to board until I checked our fragile souvenirs (there are just too many threats from this airline). I was extremely disappointed that Delta would created a situation like this which was completely avoidable. And that really happened because we were cooperating with them asking us to check our bags. It was truly a shame because at least their aircraft was very nice."

I arrived over an hour before my flight to find a line to check bags formed outside the airport entrance. When I finally got to the counter I was 5 minutes over, due to their poor planning, and the agent refused to let me check-in. Told me Iâ€™d have to take a later flight and sent me to â€œspecial servicesâ€ when I explained I have been here and in line for over 30 minutes she said it wasnâ€™t her problem. I asked where special services was and she said â€œthat large group of people of thereâ€. I explained that this whole area is one large group of people, can you be more specific. Her response was â€œfigure it outâ€. If that was deplorable enough, I then sat in the special services line for 40 minutes. Missing my flight. I was Confused as to why this line was also taking forever. To my shock, When I was at the top of the time to get the next special service agent the agent called not 1 but 2 regular bag drop passengers before he called me. I saw another special service agent do the same. At this point Iâ€™m furious and holding back tears when the agent says - sorry you missed your first flight and the next 3 are booked. I explain I have a wedding and I need to be on the 9am and she tells me thereâ€™s nothing she can do. My entire day is wrecked, I will be missing the services of a wedding I am in and the Delta agents couldnâ€™t have been ruder, unapologetic or less empathetic for the destruction they created. Terrible customer service."
631,1,20,August,2021,Economy Class,Houston , Gainesville , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Delta has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. In what world is it ok for a customer to wait 2 hours for online chat help or 2 hours on the phone to get service that is not provided online. Itâ€™s infuriating and disgusting.

Pilot just told us the van service Delta contracts to pick up flight crew from hotels dropped the ball and picked them up extremely late. It is now 6:29am and we are just now taking off from runway! Super late!  Get your act together guys!"
634,3,13,August,2021,Economy Class,Nashville , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The flight attendant was horrible. She was rude, disrespectful, and I will never fly delta again. This was the worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had. She had an attitude too. I feel if we pay money to fly with their company we should be given some respect and courtesy but I guess not with this air line. I will not be returning to this airline ever again. Extremely disappointed."
635,1,13,August,2021,Economy Class,Elmira , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,  Purchased seat upgrade. Did not go through but was charged anyway (said seat was unavailable) but took money from my account. Repurchased upgrade to another seat. It processed but was charged again. Phone hold time 45 minutes. hung up. Did chat/ nobody every came into the chat in 90 minutes. Called again twice. hold times were 2 hours there is no email. only a complaint form. They say response could take 30 days! What the heck happened to Delta. Are they trying to become Spirit? The absolute worst customer experience I have ever had with an airline and that is saying something really bad.
636,1,12,August,2021,Economy Class,Boston , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Yesterday after several calls finally I could get in touch with the airline to resolve some problems prior to my upcoming trip. First of all my ticket for the connection domestic flight was changed twice, and I was never asked if this was ok. The last changed was giving me no time to board the international flight, and also was not giving time for the people on the runway to transfer my suitcases from one plane to the other. Customer service rep resolved my problem, and Iâ€™m back on my original flight. The second problem I had, when I had to cancel my flight in April, because of increasing cases of Covid, I was charged a fee, the rep again resolved my problem, and gave me a refund. From a scale from 1 to 10, Tameka you got an 11. Thank you for your help."
637,2,12,August,2021,Economy Class,Boston , Jackson Hole , Detroit     ,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta again proved no knowledge of customer service. Flights booked on Delta.com created 1 hr transition at their main hub in ATL where flights were grounded that day for 50 min. Houston flight made up some time. Got to gate in ATL where I met 3 others who were there 15 min before departure time on DL5189 to Gainesville, but rude/crude gate attendant had shut door. Her response was too bad. Southwest would never have done such a thing. Another reminder to avoid Delta. Someone else paid for my flight or I would not have used Delta. And Iâ€™m not going to change after this horrible experience."

Delta gives 2 free bags for military members which is great, but with my family we usually pack 3 bags. I would hope that after the first 2 bags the 3rd one would be the standard 30 dollars for a personal bag. NO! Instead they wanted to charge me 150 bucks for the 3rd one. What an insult! Iâ€™m bringing things to my house for my family but instead I had to ship it! Service members, stick to Alaska from now on, where they actually care about us."
639,1,10,August,2021,Premium Economy,Denver , Bismarck , Minneapolis      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," First they overbooked the flight from Miami to Atlanta forcing 10 passengers to rebook their flight for a later time, luckily I wasn't one of them. Then the flight from Atlanta to Sao Paulo (Brazil) got delayed for 1 hr. Leading me to miss my connecting flight from Sao Paulo to Montevideo. I then had to stay 3 days in Sao Paulo, Delta covered all accommodations including hotel stay, meals and transportation. Regardless of this, the last thing I wanted after 17 hrs of flights and being at airports was to stay in a hotel in a foreign city with nothing to do. Not to mention that the food served on that flight was disgusting to say the least. It's a 5/10 just because of how accommodating they were under the circumstances, but could've been prevented all throughout."

My suitcase, despite literally being dropped right at the entrance of the plane, was sent to Minneapolis. I only learned this today after almost 18 hours and no one from Delta is reaching out to me. Baggage claim assistants were not useful at all in JFK. My company laptop and phone were in that bag, and I have no confirmation that my equipment was not tampered with. Iâ€™ve been waiting for almost 7 hours for a rep to reach out to me with the text service, and when I was able to get a rep by calling, the call dropped in minutes. Calling again now and the wait is 2 hours. Between the baggage assistants, the terminal worker who told me no my stuff was in baggage claim, not being able to speak to anyone since leaving the airport for a real update, this has been the worst customer service experience Iâ€™ve ever had. The WiFi was bad too."
641,4,9,August,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , Frankfurt        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," This is the first time I have flown with Delta. Me and my family flew from Elmira NY to Orlando Fl. Before we even left for our trip they changed our flights 5 times. As well as changing the layovers. Our trip finally got here we made it to Florida. It cost me $90 for checked baggage. The flight down wasn't too bad. They didn't offer anything special in flight. We did notice they messed up someone else's tickets and seats as well. Assigning the same seats to more than one person. When it was time for us to fly home from Florida we got to the airport and they told us it was too late for them to check our baggage and that we would have to be put on standby. Noting that there were 3 of us and only one flight going out at 4 pm and the connecting flight in Detroit only had one flight that day as well. Again leaving us on stand by for 3 people stranded without a connecting flight. And our original flight was to leave at 8.20 am from Orlando. So basically leaving us stranded in Orlando with no flight. The lady at the counter was rude, acted like she could not care less, and did not explain the process at all to us. She hurried us through and pushed us away. Leaving us with more questions than answers. We had to ask someone else, then stand in the long line again to get another agent to explain the whole standby process to us. To tell us that our chances of all three of us getting a seat on the next flight was very slim to none. We could not wait another day or two in a Florida airport nor Detroit to get a flight home when I had a 14 yr old son with me as well as having to be at work and having to get home to our animals. So we ended up having to spend more money to rent a car to drive home from Orlando Florida to New York so we were not stuck in an airport for days waiting for Delta to get us a flight. So not only did they cost me my airfare home but I had to spend money on a rental car that was another $400. I have never had such a hard time with an airline. And I have flown many times. This was my first and last time flying with Delta. Apparently my family has had the same problem with them. I will stick with my other airline from now on! This was a horrible experience."
642,2,7,August,2021,Economy Class,Pittsburgh , Sao Paulo , Atlanta     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Just dont do it! Take another airline. You are setting yourself up for hours of pure frustration if you purchase a ticket with Delta. Never mind just the rude attendants or gate people but really what will get you is the pure inability to get through to company if you need any customer service. Once you have purchased ticket only luck will save you because you surely have no guarantee you will ever reach customer service either by phone or online chat. I know this because i have logged 10 hours of my time trying to get though to change ticket because they randomly changed flight time.
643,10,6,August,2021,First Class,Charlotte , New York       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  This was by far the worst travel experience I have ever had. I can say with certainty that I will never fly delta airlines again. My flight was booked. About 12 hours before takeoff I received a text message notifying me that my flight was delayed 3 hours. Not a big deal except I had a connector flight in Salt Lake City, going to Jackson Hole, so now I would miss that flight. After calling and sitting on hold for over 3 hours I was finally in contact with someone. They then gave me an option of flying the entire day with long layovers and arriving at 8pm or a flight with two layovers but that arrival time would be similar to my original flight (12pm). Once showing up to the gate, my seat was assigned and I was put in the last row of the plane. In the middle seat next to the bathroom. Two hours to Detroit. Now 4 hour flight to Salt Lake City from Detroit my ticket says seat assigned at gate. And guess what, same thing. Now to top it off they make me check my bag at the gate. I get on the plane and every single over head bin had multiple vacancies for bags. Not sure why I had to check my bag. I tried to get my seat or flight switched to no avail. Delta airlines really doesnâ€™t care about the plans you have for flying."
644,1,6,August,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , Tampa        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  My boyfriend and I took a trip to New Orleans last month. We were of course very excited being our first time there and this was our second trip together as a couple. We started at Grand Rapids and had 1 stop at Detroit then to New Orleans. The flight from Grand Rapids to Detroit was great. The flight from Detroit then to New Orleans was horrible. I was surprised to find no TV screen in first class for that long of a flight? Very disappointing. then we noticed the silver ceiling tile about the rest room was falling down on 1 side. Not a good thing to see the airplane falling apart. Our trip back was not any better! Again leaving from to Detroit in first class with no TV screen. Then we land in Detroit to find we have a change in flight and are stuck at the airport for 3 hours till they had another plane. We finally board and are being told they are all about safety and keeping things sanitized. Thats a joke! We get to our first class seat to find finger prints on the window, dirty hand prints on side walk and arm rest and garbage in seat pocket. Then again still no TV screen. The flight attendants were being very rude and harassing customers about everything .. we all just wanted to get to our last stop. You would think they would be more understanding that we had a 3 hour delay! I was told to push my purse further under seat in front of me ... yea 2 inches really made a difference there. When we landed in Grand Rapids the ceiling panel above us came down and the flight attendant had to push it back up.  We felt totally unsafe on your plane. I made a complaint to delta. In the email it said I would hear from you in 14-21 days its been past that. So thought maybe if I leave this review I'll hear from someone.."
645,2,4,August,2021,Economy Class,New York , Bogota ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Had a 5-6 hour delay because on my incoming flight because of poor scheduling on the airlines part. My initial flight was late to get me then my second flight left without me followed by having to wait till 10 pm ish to catch the next flight to my destination. One would assume that an airline as large as delta likes to be good at what they do but I guess quality went out the door with COVID. Staffing issues also seem to be a problem. Calling in to reschedule my return flight and Iâ€™m told the wait time is over an hour? Seriously, I would imagine that Delta can afford to staff their call center well enough to be convenient instead of a hassle. Unfortunately itâ€™s been this was for years. Often times itâ€™s quicker fro me to drive to the airport to get my flight changed than it is for me to wait on the phone."
646,5,4,August,2021,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , New York      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta changed our flights last minute, messing up our schedule, so we called Delta to change our flights. The representative that changed them gave us a flight with a 54 minute layover saying it would be easy to make our connection without telling us he put us in the very back row of the plane and that we had two very far gates from each other. No one would assist us to make our connection easier. My biggest complaint is that they put my two year old in a row by herself, without me or my husband. They would not change her seat. This is very very unsafe to have a two year old next to strangers and also very upsetting to everyone in the seats around us. We shouldn't have to rely on someone us to give up their seats so we can sit with our two year old! I will be looking into laws and regulations on this and filing a complaint wherever I can about this action."
647,2,4,August,2021,Economy Class,Nashville , Missoula        ,Direct Flight,Business,Germany, Trip Verified ,  Absolutely the worst airline! Flight attendants are rude and laugh when you have an issue like my screen not working and basically just say you are out of luck. The airline allows car seats on the plane which means if you are as unfortunate as me then you canâ€™t put your seat back to sleep even though itâ€™s an overnight flight and when landing in the morning with no sleep having to proceed your drive home a few hrs away. They do not enforce a calm and relaxing flight. I spend just as much money as anyone else on my tickets to not receive a working screen and unable to put my seat back to sleep. Will never fly again and do not recommend for anyone. The airline should really learn what hospitality means.
648,1,3,August,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , Phoenix        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta had a mechanical problem, my flight suppose to leave at 7:10pm, but left 11:30pm. Pretty much all attendants were rude, short temper, and when I asked for a food voucher they said the restaurants were closed and I would eat in the airplane. Not nice!"
649,2,2,August,2021,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Nashville       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I am very disappointed in Delta Airlines, they cancelled our flight, didnâ€™t let us know, and I had to miss an extra day of work that I wonâ€™t get paid for. They could have at least warned us or sent us a notification that it got cancelled. I had to find out half way there which was an hour away from the place I was staying at so there goes my gas wasted."
650,1,30,July,2021,Business Class,Tonawanda , Las Vegas       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Absolutely ridiculous. Our flight was set for 10.32. The flight was first delayed due to them not having a flight attendant available. It was delayed for over an hour (11.46pm). They then proceeded to board everyone on the plane. The pilot came on the speaker saying that now we not only were missing a flight attendant, but also that fuel was low and they needed to dispatch someone out to put fuel for the plane. That took another 45 minutes. Waiting on a plane that hasnâ€™t even taken off yet. This flight is only 1 hour."
651,1,29,July,2021,Economy Class,New York La Guardia , Miami       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Terminal 4 was pretty dead in the morning, check in was easy but the agent did not say hi and ignored my question asking how are you so that wasnâ€™t the best first impression considering I paid more to fly Delta One. The priority lane to go through security was closed but due to the fact that the airport wasnâ€™t dead I went through in 15 minutes towards the Sky Club. Where I was actually welcomed. Boarding was very prompt and service onboard was impeccable which made up for the guy at check in being careless. Seats were comfy for the 5.5 hour flight. Due to restrictions sandwiches were served as a meal but nonetheless very tasty and about every half hour cabin crew came by to refill drinks and whatever else was needed, about an hour before landing snacks were handed out. What made this flight memorable was the attention given by crew members."
652,2,29,July,2021,Economy Class,Orange County , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Decided to pay a little extra this time to fly Delta because honestly anything is better than Spirit. After both flights I probably will never fly Delta again. I had the E-ticket on my phone which did not give me my seat assignment either time. The first time flying out of LGA to FLL the desk lady was snapping on everyone that would go up to ask for their seat, but at least there was a monitor that eventually showed seat assignments. Upon my return there was no way of knowing what the seat assignments were. I went up to the lady behind the counter greeted her and she turned her face to me. Finally she looks over with an annoyed face and I ask her if they had assigned seats. She basically told me to check my app and when I told her I donâ€™t have the app I have an e-tickets on my phone via Apple wallet she just said Iâ€™d have to wait to board once they call for all remaining passengers. Iâ€™m fuming Iâ€™ve never been in such a weird boarding situation before both times encountering extremely rude employees. Delta train your employees to be a little nicer and develop a better seating system please. Never flying Delta again."
653,1,28,July,2021,Economy Class,Las Vegas , Seattle       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Iâ€™ll never fly Delta again even if itâ€™s significantly cheaper than other options. Iâ€™m currently on hold for a single question I had. Iâ€™ve been on hold for an hour and 20 minutes when they said â€œour estimated wait time is 13 minutesâ€ Thatâ€™s 6X wrong and also made it so I couldnâ€™t bring something I needed to with me because I wasnâ€™t sure if it was allowed or not. I allowed 30 minutes to speak to someone before I had to leave, I guess I shouldâ€™ve assumed it would be more like a 1.5 hour hold+. My flight was also delayed by 3 hours, no surprise, so I wonder how Iâ€™ll make my next flight considering there was a 1 hour layover and that one is on time. I sure hope they make me wait a few more hours to figure that out. Remember, time is money, and Delta couldnâ€™t possibly care less about your time as a customer because then theyâ€™d have to hire more people and that wouldnâ€™t help their margins and stock price. Delta doesnâ€™t and never has cared about the customer, this is my 3rd time in a row Iâ€™ve had an issue with them."
654,1,28,July,2021,Premium Economy,Las Vegas , Seattle       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Have never flown with this airline but expected more from Delta. When flying with this airline a certain level of quality is expected and I am disappointed. It started out with the flight being delayed until they had access to a full crew and departure time was pushed by twice for that purpose. Then the pilot comes out to say due to regulations he could only work a certain number of hours and would not be able to fly the aircraft and we would have to wait for another pilot. Results were that the flight got pushed to the next morning . During the night the departure gate changed 3 times. Once they arrived in the morning they were a pilot short and pushed departure time once again. For those that opted to stay in the airport and wait, the overnight crew was nonchalant and blaise about the whole ordeal. In addition they were ill prepared with pillows blankets and snack boxs and were acting as if they were bothered by even extending that hospitality. They needed to do a lot more in compensation by giving skylines to a free flight, a hot meal and a pillow with blanket."
655,1,28,July,2021,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Medford , Seattle    ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Our flight (DL386) LAX-BNA on July 25th started off not well. I was traveling with my family (Myself, wife, son & Daughter). My wife was flying first class with my daughter and I was flying comfort plus with my son. Somehow leading up to the flight our seats were changed without any notice. We are traveling with small children and by law they can not sit by themselves. We found out about the seat changes trying to check in 24hrs in advance. We could not fix our seats together and were told (after holding for 6 hours on the phone) to wait until we reached the gate. We arrived at the airport and there was only one gate attendant with a long line of customers. She was not attending to any of them. Finally someone in line spoke up and she was flustered. She dismissed half of the people in line to go sit down. They were told to deal with their issue at the scanning of boarding passes. We were still seat separated from our children. I finally spoke up and she addressed the situation to get us seated together. Our flight departed a bit late and upon approach into BNA our captain notified us that there was heavy weather and we may have to divert to Memphis. He circled three times and aborted the landing at BNA. We landed in Memphis (1/2 hour from BNA) and are notified that we need to refuel before we can go back and to land at BNA as the storm has now cleared. We now hear from the Captain on the PA that he and his cockpit crew have ""timed out"". We are asked to deplane and wait for alternative cockpit crew. Our flight was initially supposed to land at BNA at 5:11pm, It's now 5:55 as we begin to deplane at Memphis. We find ourselves now at an airport with no restaurants open. Our children are starving. I spend $80 buying junk and jerky at the airport store to tide them over. We now hear from the gate that our incoming pilots will not arrive until 8:30pm (which actually turned into 9:45 because of the incoming delayed flight from Atlanta). We contemplate driving ourselves back to BNA, but that would be a 3 hour drive with the kids. We are now held captive in an airport with no food, an extremely long day of travel and no help from Delta staff or crew. They tell us the only thing available at this airport right now is the drinking fountain and then laugh about it. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of planning and customer service coverage the Delta staff. I understand the timing out of pilots, however the situation after the diverted flight should have been handled better. We were not the only parents with upset, hungry and tired children so my feelings here are mutual as all passengers on flight DL386 where unhappy about the lack of customer service and planning. There was nothing offered to snack on let alone to drink. Even as we re-boarded with the new pilot crew. The staff on flight DL386 didn't offer any snacks that we could see from our seats in first class. Yet when the pilots came on board they handed them both large Bistro Snack Boxes. I'm extremely disappointed with Delta and the crew. This situation could have been handled so much better. We finally got to BNA by 10:30pm( 5 hours after our initial arrival time to BNA) It's now 11:30pm by the time we get the kids home. They're now eating at 11:45pm. NOT a great situation or Delta experience to say the LEAST!!We have a choice when we travel. I hope this helps future travelers"
656,4,28,July,2021,Economy Class,Baltimore , Nassau        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  My experience with Delta was absolutely horrible. I missed my connecting flight and was forced to spend the night in Detroit airport. When I originally boarded this flight I was reassured by staff that if I missed my connecting flight there would be ticket agents available to find us a hotel and food when we landed. This never happened so as forced to sleep in the airport. Airport staff also threatened me that if I left the airport I would no longer be secure. I have never felt so scared and alone in my life. This was the worst experience of my 45 years of life. It took me over 30 hours to travel from Las Vegas to Buffalo New York. I am astonished with the lack of humanity and respect that I was shown by the staff of Delta Air Lines. It will be a long time before I fly again. Rest assured it will not be with Delta!
657,1,27,July,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I sent this complaint to the airlines on Tuesday, June 29, 2021. I requested a reply, which I haven't received.  I only edited the review by eliminating the religious group to which the two passengers next to me belong. I was sitting on an aisle seat when two young men who I could tell from their attire are of a strict religious group, asked the young man across the aisle, without addressing me, if he and I could switch seats. Due to religious reasons, they wanted to have a man sit there. We both said no, because the man across the aisle was sitting with his wife and son. I suggest airlines screen their passengers better for religious preferences. Furthermore, these two young men took their masks off most of the flight. I told one of the flight attendants, and she told them to put them on, which they did until she left. A passenger behind us also told them to put them on to no avail. Flight attendants walked up and down the aisle and never told them to put their masks on. Personally, I wore two masks which I didn't take off the entire flight even to drink water. Since we had to circle off on the Atlantic due to thunderstorms in South Florida, I was uncomfortable and, of course, thirsty. I went to the lavatory once and noticed that other passengers who were not eating, also had their masks off."

My daughter had a direct flight from Orange County Ca to Atl Ga and somehow got diverted to another airport and no one contacted me, I was sitting at the airport waiting for her when I got a call from her freaking out cause she landed in another airport and she doesn't know why and no one told me anything. After speaking to a manager in the airport from Delta, she told me that my daughter is fine and to calm down she will get there when she gets there and that the weather was so bad that they couldn't land but all the other planes seem to be landing just fine and there was no rain, no black clouds it was clear as day sun shinning and 95 out. But the weather was so bad they landed somewhere else and then didn't contact her mother ever even after they sat there for 3 hours. On top of that my daughter was on the phone crying and the flight attendant told her to stop crying and that she was fine and freaking out for no reason. Thank god there was a Mom sitting behind her with her kids who stuck up for her and reassured her that it was going to be ok and that she was there if she needed anything. We fly with southwest and pay 50 dollar unaccompanied minor fee and have never had an issue they tell us if they are running late or even when she has had a not direct flight and they land and change planes the flight attendant will text you and let you know all is well. I have contacted them but I just do not want another child and parent to go through this don't fly your unaccompanied minor with Delta."

We were clicking around trying to find the best flights, and thought we had. Turns out once we clicked back, the dates changed and so did the traveler names (my wife was booking for me and my boys and ended up booking for herself and the boys, and the dates changed by a month!). Tried to call Delta and the hold time was 9 hours! Tried the chat and couldn't get a live person. Ended up missing our 24 hours free cancellation window and had to pay $50 to change my name, but they forgot to change the dates. Now another 9 hours on hold to update to the correct date. We also tried changing to an earlier flight on our last Delta trip, by changing flights took longer than the flight itself."

One flight attendant in particular was wiping his sweat on his gloved hand and touching everyone's cups and ice, etc, yet my husband's mask fell down for a split second while he was talking and the guy instantly yells ""pull it up, over your mouth and nose"" as he was pulling it back up. He also stood over my 21 and 23 year old daughters while they were eating to make sure they were pulling it up between bites. Every few minutes they come across the loudspeaker reminding you to keep it up no matter what even in between bites or you will be removed from the plane. We are adults, we know the rules and we don't need a constant announcement disrupting us throughout the flight and airline staff using intimidation tactics while practicing disgusting and unsanitary behaviors themselves."

That was not the case when leaving Slc to Seattle. Missed the flight because of the extra time for boarding added on that was not disclosed. Also the announcements are really hard to understand. Talk as fast as you can with mush in your mouth is the norm. Plus echoing makes it hard to hear announcements Let's upgrade the speaker system. They got us on another flight and it was much appreciated. Lost four hours of life waiting. However, agent never bothered to tell us second flight moved to a different gate and this change was not on the ticket he printed. Luckily we asked another agent.

Currently sitting in the plane on the Boise tarmac waiting to be brought BACK to salt lake. Folks are needing to get off here, missing checked bags, no more food on board.

665,1,22,July,2021,Economy Class,Detroit , Milwaukee        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," What a mistake! I usually travel to TLV almost every year for last three decades via El Al. Being a new American Express Platinum member, I was encouraged (points-wise) to go by Delta. Turns out: Awful Choice! It started bad, on the the plane for several hours at LAX waiting for take off, while they fixed the problem of ""a door not closing"". By the time I got to JHK late that night, I had of course missed my connecting flight to TLV. We were given vouchers ""for the hotel"". Us four stranded parties went to that Airport Holiday Inn, only to find when we got there that the vouchers were not for the room - as the typical credit card number was not on it. Turns out, we were mislead as these were only to get a rate. One of the parties had to sleep in the lobby because there was in fact no room. Further, because of this passage of time, we has to retake the COVID-test ($225) the next day on top of paying the hotel ($150) and lose a day in travel. When I went to be reimbursed, the airline (the ""we care team"" - which I prefer to think of as ""We could not care less team"") declined to do so, saying a passenger had caused the door problem and therefore they could evoke an act of god ""Force Majeure"" exemption not to compensate - a first in all my travels! (Great lawyers they have, apparently) Next time El-Al!"

Tried to upgrade seat and told that the ticket we bought was non refundable and not available to upgrade at any cost. This is the absolute worst policy ever. I was willing to spend good money to upgrade at the gate and was told we couldn't. This information was also never presented or buried so deep in the fine print that no one reads. I will never fly Delta again.
667,1,21,July,2021,Economy Class,Tampa , Detroit        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Worst airline experience ever! Iâ€™ve flown many different airlines before, but Iâ€™ve never had so many problems like I have with Delta. This was my first and LAST time flying Delta. I had originally booked a roundtrip, direct flight from ONT to ATL months in advance. Then, a few weeks before, the scheduled flight Delta kept changing my return home flight time (3 times). Eventually they had changed it from a departure time of 5pm to 8am, which is a huge difference in time change. Not only did they change the time, but they changed the return airport from ONT to LAX! I was not ok with either of these drastic changes to the flight I originally booked. I called a Delta representative and told him what had happened. He told me he could make the changes and reschedule me to a direct 4:30pm flight. I assumed things were fixed. It wasnâ€™t until the day before my return flight, when I was supposed to check in, did I realize that he still had my flight booked for the wrong airport (LAX). I then had to spent over 3 hrs on hold waiting to speak to a Delta customer service representative, and over a half hour talking to someone to get my flight fixed. She told me all the direct flights to ONT were sold out, and I would have to take a connecting flight which would be later in the evening arriving to ONT at 11:30pm. I asked if I could wait for standby on a direct flight at 5:50pm. She said she would put me on the list for standby. I was waiting early for standby at the airport until all passengers had finished boarding, as I was directed by the gate Delta attendant. They even said there was one seat that I could take, but when they tried adding me to the seat, they said there was a problem. The system couldnâ€™t give me a direct flight because I only paid for a connecting flight. When I showed them that I did pay for a direct flight they said the representative who booked me this morning did it wrong then. And there was nothing they could do for me. No one tried to compensate me for all of the problems Delta caused with my flight. I feel very unappreciated as a customer. I plan to use other airlines that value their customers time and money from now on."

It was nice to have those screens to watch stuff and play games on. Almost everything about it was great. Most of the flight attendants were really nice. But there was one who was awful. Made fun of me to other people for not being able to find a button. She made me feel uncomfortable the whole flight and the people who were sitting across the aisle from me are who she made fun of me to, so it felt really awkward sitting by them too. She shouldn't be talking about people like that, especially since she doesn't know what they might have. I have a learning disability that can make it harder to understand things. I know there are plenty of people who do where it's hard to see that they have a disability and I wouldn't be surprised at all if she acts like that with far more people. Regardless of whether someone has a disability or not, it's not okay to treat people like that, especially customers. She certainly was by far the worst of any of the ones who helped us."

I arrived pretty late for check-in (45 minutes prior to departure) and my agent seemed at first apprehensive in wanting to assist me due to my late arrival. However, with some convincing, she came around and called the gate. I would have rated ground service higher if I felt her first approach was to help me by checking albeit seeming difficult instead of the no reception I got. The inflight experience was better than my ground one. There were many hours of inflight entertainment to watch and free Wi-Fi connectivity was available for basic messaging on apps like WhatsApp, which is an appreciated amenity. Yummy Kind bars and Cheez It crackers were passed out alongside a choice of beverage, although a meal like a sandwich would be preferred anytime. The crew were your quintessential American flight attendant, not the most polished, but friendly, chatty and approachable which I appreciate because it feels like home. Insofar as seat comfort, it was fine less the seat pouch in front of me that was stretched out, eating into my leg space. As my preferred US carrier, I will keep giving my business to Delta when the price is right."

They do not care about the connection. They only want to sell their part of the routes. They donâ€™t flight directly to Greece as Delta make me believe when I was booking. They do not have any direct communication with Air France as per an Air France manager in New York Kennedy airport told me. They were late with their flight from Miami to New York Kennedy Airport and and I missed my flight with Air France. On top Air France was able to open the gate of the flight to allow an emergency entry but Delta knowing that we were going to be late sold our tickets and they couldnâ€™t hold the flight to clear and purchase new tickets."

They charged for 4 luggage, only said it was paid for 2 because their system was malfunctioning. Had to throw an entire suitcase away and put my sons stuff in carry-on trash bag. They forgot to print my sons ticket out, ran back to get it. Forgot to give me my ID back, ran back to get it. Finally got boarded, and the flight attendant allowed us to have 1 extra luggage we paid for, put down bow for free. Couldn't the old guy at the front have done that in the 1st place! Flight delayed an hour, picked up luggage from baggage claim and 1 suitcase had a hole ripped in the back and the handle broken. Baggage office said it still had the contents inside, so nothing could be done. I'm beyond over all of it! I will never fly with Delta again.

There were thousands of people in line. People were missing their flights and Delta representatives didn't care. The lines were from one end of the airport to the other.

It was a horrific experience waiting in line for over 2 hours & hardly moving and knowing you will never get though the line and make it through security. Instead of 3 hours early with Delta plan on 8 hours. All the other airlines had no lines. Their customers were in and out. Shame on Delta Air Lines."

The 2 more 1hr delays to be told the pilot now timed out and had to be flown from Atlanta to Tampa to fly the plane. We did not leave til after Midnight on a 5:05 departure. Now on a hot plane that the stewardess told them to get started and not to board until they cool down was ignored I am sure some executive who was off site. So now 6hrs late, hot as hell and finally told by another stewardess I could not have head phones till we reached altitude to get my mind off this horrific flight."

The gate agent could not assist me and I would be missing my connecting to ATL to ABY. I asked the agent if they could provide a rental car and I would drive home. I paid extra money to flight to and from ABY so I wouldnâ€™t have to drive. The last flight available from ATL to aaBay was sold out and the next flight was in the morning at 10. The gate agent stated that I could receive a refund or eCredit for all of the issues. Now itâ€™s 3 days later and Iâ€™m still waiting to speak with someone about all the problems I had.

675,7,14,July,2021,First Class,Sarasota , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My flight was delayed 4 times then canceled. Their reason was the pilot was running late. By the 3rd delay passengers were told the pilot called out of work. One would think Delta is just now finding this out now. And why a backup plan was not in place. We were held waiting for another pilot until they canceled the flight and the Delta crew behind the counter fled. A lot of passengers wanted answers. My flight was moved to 8pm the next day. (already 2 days of vacation down the drain). Just when I thought it couldn't get any worst, when trying to fly back home the plane was once again delayed. The reason? They need 5 flight attendants to fly. They only had 4 currently because  the 5th person is stuck in traffic. When the 5th flight attendant showed up ... all 5 of them had lunch at another gate so they won't be seen. Unbelievable know they caused the delay. By the time we boarded the weather has gotten worst and I am literally sitting in the plane on the runaway on another delay writing this review. This would be the 3rd delay by now. Delta really is the worst airline there is and I would never purchase or flying delta again."

First we waited over one hour on the runway and nobody informed us of the delay. When a passenger next to me pressed the call button the flight attendant stated we were waiting in line to take off. She said the captain announced that but we never heard the announcement. Next we air in the air and the captain comes on speaker stating that thereâ€™s bad weather in DC, and AC wants us to stay in the air for one extra hour but we donâ€™t have enough fuel to do that. The captain said weâ€™re going to go to Richmond Virginia for fuel. We landed in Richmond the fuel was on the ground waiting for us as we landed. Shortly after the fuel was given the captain comes on speaker again and states that the weather is good and we headed to BWI. Iâ€™m very frustrated with the miscommunication and delayed services with lack of empathy for peopleâ€™s time. Never will I travel Delta again. I never witnessed such nonsenses.

681,3,9,July,2021,Economy Class,Detroit , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Recently this Thursday, I had the worst experience I have ever encountered on a flight. My family and I had important plans to fly into New York, LGA. However, during our flight, about a half an hour away from LGA the captain of the plane informed us we will be having a delay and they will be stopping the plane in Atlanta. We were upset but understood this is due to weather conditions, and they let us know it would probably be a 1-2 hour delay and to stay close to the terminal when we get off the airplane. When we got off, we were then informed that our flight was actually going to be delayed until 8am in the morning! Shocked, we proceeded to find a help desk to see what we were going to do. As we were walking, we noticed another flight that was boarding for the same place we were supposed to go to, LGA! We were so confused on how they were able to go but we were not? We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the same tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves! We were also told the flight would be departing at 8am, so we had to wake up early in the morning and catch the 5.30am shuttle to Atlanta Airport. This is really when the true nightmare began, as we asked an employee where we should go with our tickets, and she told us since we already had the tickets from our delayed flight we could hop in line for the regular security route. So, after waiting 15-20 minutes in line we went up to the employee who scans the boarding passes and was told â€œWe cannot take these passes you need new ones, leave out that exit doorâ€ and we were rudely told to leave as the employee got frustrated with us as we were trying to explain our situation. We then got in line for Special Services, which the security employee directed us too by pointing. It was 5.30am and there was no employees there to even help us yet because they were in a briefing, so we were told by another employee they wonâ€™t be available until 6am! Astonished, we got in another line for Special Services and waited about 25 more minutes. We were then greeted by a man all the way at the right side corner, and we attempted to explain our situation with him. He got very rude with us and told us our flight was now taking off at 6.30am and that he would not give us new boarding passes and insisted that we could use the same ones we had even after getting kicked out of security! My father tried to explain further to him, and he replied â€œWould you rather just sit here and argue with me and miss you flight?â€ I was astonished by this type of treatment, I truly felt like I was highly disrespected after spending over 1000 dollars this month on flights with Delta! He refused to even look at our boarding passes. We then headed over back by security and began trying to explain our situation to another lady who told us we needed new boarding tickets as well. However, another worker heard us in distress and walked over to us. She was a customer relations worker, I had forgotten to get her name however she was the nicest most helpful woman."

Last time I'm flying with Delta, and I didn't even step in the plane yet. The line at check-in was 1.5hr long with a completely disorganized and bossy employee giving us life lessons repeatedly on arriving late if we didn't show up 3 hours before taking off. We arrived 2hrs ahead, which is plenty, and I don't feel like being infantilized by people failing miserably at their jobs. All of this to be left standing an additional 2hrs in the hall with barely enough seats for a quarter of the passengers. I felt really badly for the families and the seniors. The communication on the multiple delays was poor. We will be taking off at least one hour late. It happens but simply made the whole circus we endured for the previous 4hrs all the more pointless."

However they did respond to others around us, and enforced the mask policy to people directly in front of and behind my row. When I called to file a complaint I was told that it was not a concern to my health. This person was wearing her mask in the airport gate waiting area. I get makes are uncomfortable.

They would not even give me an e credit towards the rebooking of my flight. They said because it was more than 24 hours after booking I couldn't make the change. I tried to make the change in the allotted time but their website wouldn't let me. When I tried calling in the had a 7 hour hold time. I tried several times in the following days always receiving a hold time of over 2 hours. I tried to do their chat on the website but couldn't get through to anyone. Delta made it nearly impossible to make any changes to my ticket and when I finally get through they say there is nothing they can do even though I want to immediately rebook. It would cost them nothing to give me an e credit towards booking another flight.

It was supposed to be a simple day of travel and Delta turned it into a full day of misery. I wish that there were actual staff working with Delta to make a better customer experience, but they do not have that even to a fraction, unless you count a scripted response from every employee to keep sending you on a run around trying to get an answer to when you will get to the place you paid to go.

The lunch box given was pitiful and sad and quite frankly betrayed laziness. We are already past that curve of covid where you can get away with not offering service using that excuse. It is blatantly an act of being cheap on the part of the airline. The service was awful. The young gentleman that served us was probably the least friendly flight attendant I have ever encountered especially given he is serving first class passengers which makes it worse. Unsmiling, unfriendly, looked bored and uninterested in his job. There was a young lady who also came and checked the cabin during take off and landing equally unfriendly and sporting 2 inch white nails which was shocking. This would have been unheard of in a European airline where grooming standards are closer to what they should be, but I guess this is Delta so anything goes, including gross nails. Overall I am not impressed and we fly Delta a lot due to the fact that my partner has the highest status with Delta. Something I'd like to encourage him to shift to another airline that is more concerned with passenger experience and customer service standards."

I tried to get a refund by waiting on hold for more than 4 hours and never got through to anyone at Delta. I called many times. They have taken down the email address for customer complaints online so there is no practical way to get my refund for literally $400 I paid.  My baggage was also lost.
700,1,30,June,2021,Economy Class,Grand Rapids , Orlando       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  It is impossible to get through to Delta to speak to customer service or to book a flight by phone in order to clarify some questions. It feels like Delta is taking the lazy way out. I am disappointed.
701,1,29,June,2021,Economy Class,Chicago , Ft Lauderdale       , Atlanta     ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Terrible, terrible service. Will not fly Delta aver again. I booked a R/T flight from Washington Dulles to Rome, Italy. My children were going 10 days ahead of me and my son's friend's Dad was trying to book a flight that married up to mine so he could travel with me to join us on vacation. My son's friend's Dad called to ask of I knew that my flights had been cancelled. ""No"" was my reply as this was in no way ever communicated to me. We then checked on the flights of my children and learned that their flights had also been cancelled with no notice. Wow ... not even an e-mail with an update. I called numerous tome with lengthy waits. One morning, I waited 2 hours and 10 minutes, but got through to customer service. I cancelled our flights and the woman on the line asked us to hold while she went to check on the refund. She came back and, before providing us an answer, asked us to call back! Really! Well, I did call back and was put into a queue that stated that I would receive a call in the next 2 hours. Six hours later, I did receive that call. The gentlemen was quite helpful. The tickets had been cancelled and fully refunded...thought no confirmation e-mail evert sent. This little mishap of an experience is now over. I would like to point out, though, that we had this exact same experience last summer with similar flights between Washington Dulles and Rome Fiumincino. These flights were Alitalia flights in both instances. After reading this review, should you still choose to book with Delta, I would strongly recommend you check your flight status on occasion prior to your trip so you do not find yourself standing at the airport on the day you think your are flying only to find your flight has been cancelled. I will no have to concern myself with this as I will never again fly Delta Airlines. The only thing I will do is continue to share my story with any who ask about my experience with Delta."

From the start of this trip itâ€™s been a nightmare getting help. First our flight was delayed out of Portland for over 3 hrs which made us miss our International flight/connection in Minneapolis. We ended up losing a day and a half of our trip to Iceland. Then while in Iceland My mother was in a really bad accident and was in the ICU. I need to speak with someone to change my flight to come home early. I had to wait for over 3 hrs on the phone to get help. My husband stayed in Iceland to finish out the trip. My mother has taken a decline and now wonâ€™t pull through so my husband is trying to get home to be here before she passes and can not get through to anyone to help. Itâ€™s a 9 hour hold. Delta talks about how much they care and how important customer service is but there is zero customer service!! I am so disappointed in this airline.
703,2,29,June,2021,Premium Economy,Atlanta , Boise        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified , First call to customer service to get precheck added to ticket - 50 min and they disconnect me. 2nd call - 2.3 hours and again disconnected me. Both done evening before today. 3rd call at 6 am day of flight 58 min and they disconnected me again! I will never fly Delta again. Just wow. 3 times! How can you say customer service is a priority or even a concern with this business practices.
704,1,28,June,2021,Economy Class,San Diego , Detroit       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," Iâ€™ve flown three different airlines this month and Delta is by far the most difficult and unimpressive to fly with. The staff I have encountered is generally rude and arrogant. The customer and their needs are never a priority. I watched as one gate attendant got in a screaming match with a passenger who didnâ€™t check her bag at gate and refused to believe the passenger when she said she didnâ€™t hear her ask her to check it (despite the employee wearing a mask which makes it difficult for anyone to communicate). It then turned out there was plenty of bin space and no bags needed to be checked. They are rude and in your face monitoring mask compliance. Understandably itâ€™s a difficult situation, but other airlines still manage to treat passengers with respect when asking for compliance."

Unfortunately, my son just got Covid and we arenâ€™t able to fly. I tried cancelling on the website, but it wouldnâ€™t give me a refund for credit. Iâ€™m currently on hold with Delta for over 4 hours! No option for me to leave a call back number. Iâ€™m going to go to sleep soon and will have to hang up! 4 hours and counting! Horrendous customer service."

The airport in Orlando was shut down due to bad weather. We had to be directed to Miami to wait for the storm to subside or to get directions from air control. The pilot kept the passengers informed as he was informed. Although it was uncomfortable waiting on the tarmac but he calmed us by staying calm and keeping up informed. My hat goes off to him."
707,2,27,June,2021,Economy Class,San Jose , Orlando       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Where do I start. Arrived 1.5 hrs ahead of my flight and paid the fee to ensure I would not lose my flight or be bumped. Followed all standard protocols and abided by all rules. Remind you my flight was booked to leave early A.M. so arrival in Chicago would leave me enough time to get a full day's work in and return to Florida mid-day. Arrived at Fll at 4am. Our flight was at 5:30 am. with a connection in Atlanta. Plane broke on the runway. Then the plane needed fuel, then the plane broke again. Anyways my flight was changed 2 times before we arrived in Atlanta and when we arrived at 8:54 our connection had just left at 9am. Missed that one too. Then they put me on the 11am flight. Last 2 seats but we made it. Arrived in Chicago 4 hours late. And then had to set there until 4pm because they forgot our tools for the job in Atlanta. We missed the appointment to work on the vessel and all reservations were missed. Our return flight was at 10am by luck we had a chance to have a conversation with the yacht owner who was very disappointed and asked if we could at least come come and look at the vessel since we had made the trip up there. The only thing Delta did correct was we schedule our flight for 6:30pm Saturday. Which gave us the time to see the customer. When we made it to boarding and was filing on to the aircraft the flight attendant had an issue with another passenger that we weren't even with who was drinking or drunk not sure as I was not with him. But she advised us to get off the plane. Then she proceeded to tell the captain and redcoat she felt endangered.  To end the story that left me sleeping on the floor until at the airport until this morning at 7:30am. I'm writing my review on the plane waiting to take off and I'm livid! This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had flying in 30 years. No beverages, rude people, old planes, and allowing some inexperienced individuals with no one to answer to running the show."

Brian and Caleb in South Bend were awesome. They were so calm, accommodating and friendly throughout the entire process. They were also extremely dedicated and hardworking. The flights were very delayed on Saturday night so I know they worked very late but returned the next morning with smiles on their faces. They were the last people we saw before we left to go to the hotel and the first ones we saw the next morning. Our new seat assignments allowed me and my 2 kids to sit together. Honestly, the best travel experience even with a need to spend the night in a hotel and a delayed return home. A big thanks to the Delta South Bend Airport staff, especially Caleb and Brian. Great job.."
709,1,27,June,2021,Economy Class,Atlanta , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Booked months in advance, then the airline wanted to separate my husband & myself on separate flights. Then on the way back booked us in separate rows. Called customer service and was hung up on by 4 separate people. Another call placed to attempt to rectify the situation and I was on hold for well over half an hour. This flight was done in preparation for our father-in-law's funeral it's bad enough to deal with a death in the family and then to be treated like this  when you pay well over $1,000 just for a weekend of flight. I can tell you that Delta Air Lines will receive not one red cent from this family again."
710,1,26,June,2021,Economy Class,Spokane , Charlotte        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  This is easily the worst experience I've ever had. 2 hours before our flight at 10 at night I received an email saying your flight I'd canceled till the next day. I couldn't get anybody on the phone. They wouldn't accommodate me at all. We had to sleep on the floor in the airport. Then flying home They did the same thing!!!! Again with 0 accountability or doing anything to rectify the situation. I will never fly Delta again.  Worst airline ever.
711,1,26,June,2021,Premium Economy,Houston , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I was told on the phone that you wouldnâ€™t serve nut products on my flight due to my nut allergy. My flight from ny to Vegas, I was accommodated. The flight home I had to beg for my own safety because your flight attendant had no care for my safety. She told me they would serve nuts regardless of my life threatening allergy.  I canâ€™t believe how I was treated after having such a good experience the first time.  I was told by the boss of the attendants on the plane that he was obligated to serve nuts if a passenger requested it. I understand that some people may bring their own snacks, but not serving nuts shows that you care about my safety and are reducing my risk of a life threatening reaction by almost 100%. Once the captain heard my story, he had no issues switching the snacks to just pretzels and cliff bars. He even walked through the plane to tell everyone nuts would not be served. Then the attendants listened to him, after making me feel less than human for having an allergy and told that peopleâ€™s need to snack on nuts was more important than my life."
712,2,25,June,2021,First Class,Santo Domingo , Detroit , Providence     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This isnâ€™t so much about the flight, it is more about their customer service. I wanted to take my dog on a flight and online it says you have to call their customer service to get your pet on board. There is currently a 2 hour wait to talk to customer service. I called earlier and it was a 7 hour wait. Under any circumstances this is unacceptable! There is also no option for them to call you back. This is just poor service in the year 2021! Very unsatisfactory!"
713,2,24,June,2021,Economy Class,Phoenix , Indianapolis        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  The worst first class flight I have ever traveled and a waste of hard earned money. No food was offered beside a box of cheap snacks, no drinks but water, no service for both parts of flight. Small seats, no room for personal bag to stay with me. I feel so ripped off! I travel first or business class for all flights over three hours. I will not use Delta again. On trip back I paid extra for a shorter flight with minimal stops. Paid extra to have my boys sit together and Delta chanted all flights removing pre paid seats and separated our boys. The new flight added many hours to our journey. Not a pleasant experience. I had a choice between Delta and American for the trip and even though Delta was more booked it for more direct flight. So disappointed."
714,8,23,June,2021,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , New York      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  We were a party of 4 flying from Denver, CO to Maui, HI. We had booked this trip almost 6 months prior, and I had a choice of seats, and picked out the ones I wanted. However this flight was switched a few months back, and although they specified to check the schedule change, which I did, and there was just a few minutes difference in time. I did not think that I would have to check my seats, as I assumed they would transfer with the flight. They did not! I found this out the day before our flight, and I scrambled to find adjoining seating for the 4 of us, and was successful in locating seating for us, it was in the middle and not window seats like I had originally chosen. I called Delta hoping that I would be able to speak with an agent and get things changed. I was told by a recorded message that the wait time could be up to 3 hrs! which is ridiculous, however, I was determined to speak to someone to get changes made to our seating arrangement. 1 hr went by, and then 2! Still no answer. After waiting until 3 hrs and 3 minutes, I decided i had had enough, and took a screen shot to prove to Delta that I had tried to make changes to my seating arrangements to no avail!. On to Baggage Check. Check-In went reasonably well, and the Baggage Check-In Process went fairly quickly. This was the first time we had flown Delta in a long time. We usually travel using Southwest, and are used to their Baggage Check-In and Boarding Process. Needless to say, I was surprised at the baggage fees we were charged. On Southwest your baggage is free! Not the case with Delta. It cost $30 for the 1st checked bag and $40 for a second. For the 4 of us we had 6 bags, and it cost me $200! I should have done more checking on this prior to purchasing tickets. The only reason for flying Delta in the first place was that they fly larger jets to Hawaii than Southwest, and so we thought we'd be more comfortable, which we later found out not to be the case. Next came the boarding process, and after waiting for everyone else to board, finally it was our turn to go and find our seats that I was forced to endure. Our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City was delayed due to an air conditioning issue? In any case it caused enough of a delay that when we landed in Salt Lake City, we were told that they were doing a final boarding call for our flight to Maui. We ran with our carry on luggage down the concourse for about a quarter mile or so, and they were just closing the door on the jetway and informed us that we had just barely made it. We told them that there were a couple of others from our flight also on their way, but they did not seem concerned, and closed the jetway door behind us. Flight to Hawaii was pretty uneventful, but while our beverage requests were taken care of, it was evident that the flight attendants were not happy with their jobs. It seemed like everything that we asked of them was a burden. The snacks are another thing. No variety at all. We were offered the same snacks over and over on each of the 4 legs of our trip. Almonds and Biscoff cookies.  We will be flying Southwest next time. About the only annoying thing about that airline is that you need to be prompt in your check-in 24 hrs in advance in order to get an A or B pass."
715,1,22,June,2021,Economy Class,Santo Domingo , Rhode Island      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  We were returning from a family vacation first time traveling with kids. We had a flight booked with Delta from ATL airport on Fatherâ€™s Day leaving at 12:15 PM going to JFK Airport . We arrived at the airport three hours early as we try to prepare flying with small children. First we were never told that while traveling with an infant on lap we will be required to formally check in and will not be able to use the kiosk. The lines of formally check in took us about an hour and a half with two young children in a double stroller. We kept telling them was there another way for us to check in or asking for help as both children were not able to tolerate the wait. We were told we had to wait in that line however they were pulling off people with pets to make sure they were checked in on time for their flight. An hour and a half later we finally reached the check-in, we checked in went through security and arrived at the gate at 12:03 PM where there was a whole debacle of people Up in arms as they were flying standby. I tried to make my way up to the counter to explain we had tickets and weâ€™re on this plane. The girl told me we were too late and our tickets were given away and to go to see customer service. There I am traveling with a one-year-old and a three-year-old and our bags trying to get on my flight that they gave our tickets away as we were not there 15 minutes early. However the plane was still there still boarding but they gave our tickets away. We headed to customer service for Delta by the time we got a supervisor involved the plane had already left. Once the supervisor realized this was a mistake made and we shouldâ€™ve been able to board our scheduled flight he put us on the next flight which was hours later. Now sitting in an airport for 5 to 6 hours with two babies was a horrible experience. But this is not the worst of it we finally land at JFK airport about 6:45 PM with our two children to find our luggage was not there. Delta at JFK told us he never left Atlanta and he said it up to be shipped to our residence home for the following day. The following day came and our luggage with never sent I called five different times and heard five different stories first I heard it was in Atlanta then I heard it was in JFK then I heard it came in on the first flight that we were scheduled to be on it donâ€™t know what happened to it then I heard that it came in on the second flight that we were on they donâ€™t know what happened to it and then I was hung up on. Finally being fed up I demanded a callback from a supervisor as in this luggage was medical equipment for my infant daughter. My daughter was born with bilateral hip dislocation and was it a body cast the first half of her life no she currently uses a hip brace to prevent her hips from falling out of place. She is supposed to wear this every night at bedtime this brace cost a few thousand dollars. After being so rudely treated and lied to I had to let the Delta representative know that any harm done to my childâ€™s progress with her hips Delta would be accountable for and I will make sure of it then all the sudden a supervisor called me back. My bag was suddenly found she said itâ€™s been at JFK the whole time but they did not want to ship it"

After trying three different numbers I finally found help. Then they had no record of my wife's and my tickets when we arrived at the airport, so they had to reroute us. Then they had no record of my ticket on the way back home although it worked out alright. Worst of all, we discovered that my wife's brand-new never-before-used cloth bag looked like they had literally dragged it through the mud! But at least they agreed to pay for it, and the people who worked with us were helpful."

By the time they let me go the plane had already departed and they wanted me to pay $416.00 for another ticket. Also the young lady working the gate counter needs a whole lot of training. She was so nasty rude and disrespectful. I wouldnâ€™t recommend Delta Worst airline ever. I wonâ€™t ever book through them again. Out of all my years of flying this is the worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had.

Flight that was delayed until after midnight this morning was cancelled, and everyone put up at a hotel after a two hour wait in line. At the hotel, no one from Delta had made arrangements. Waited in line there until 3:30Am. Back to the airport by shuttle bus at 8:00AM, but no staff available for checkin. More waiting in line. After being promised expedited check-in and immigration processing, stood for twenty minutes at the desk waiting for new reservations (N.B. Delta staff should look up the definition of ""expedited."" ) It seems that no one had remembered to transfer the reservation from the cancelled flight to the new one, as had been promised. No expedited customs and immigration. Now at the gate at 11:50 AM waiting to board a flight that was supposed to leave at 11:30 AM. What is wrong with this airline? Is it run by incompetents or by malicious demons bent on torturing passengers? The sauce on the pudding will be watching the sappy video on the plane featuring the CEO telling me how much he cares. That is assuming that this plane leaves the ground."

I have waited 2 days trying to change one of our flights. We finally got hold of someone and they booked the flight incorrectly? From what my wife and I heard Delta is having trouble hiring employees because of the works atmosphere. Current state getting mediocre. I will never fly this airline again. If you don't trust me book your flight and pray you don't have to change anything. If you do think of me.

Upon arrival to Syracuse, I immediately went to the baggage department to file a claim. The surly Delta employee made sure to constantly mention during our conversation that what happened was considered ""acceptable damage that will not be covered"". The way he chose to speak to me was certainly an attempt to provoke a response or argument from me. After I insisted that he file a claim and that I was not willing to leave the airport since I know that a claim may not be honored if one leaves, the rude employee handed me the claim form and told me the next step is for me to wait to be contacted. He kept the bag sticker tag. Fast forward over a month of not hearing anything, I called only to find out that I was supposed to fill out another claim form online using the code the agent in Syracuse gave me. The bag tag sticker he kept is also needed to fill out this online form. That means my claim is no longer able to progress any further. A $120 bag damaged."

Not many flights were coming in (obviously) due to the fact it was 10.50pm. Really? The one gate we needed was occupied! Absolutely ridiculous. Many passengers were extremely upset and stressed because they had connecting flights, who knows if they even caught them. This is despicable.

On the Delta site it says meals are served the same as in first class, alcohol is complimentary. The plane was outdated, I was freezing sitting in the first row, my TVâ€™s touch screen buttons werenâ€™t working. Only soda, tea and coffee served, alcohol only for purchase. I was freezing and asked a flight attendant if they have blankets, they didnâ€™t have any. Since the screen wasnâ€™t working, I wanted to use my iPad with gogoinflight but screen was saying entertainment temporarily unavailable. I can give only one star to this airline.

Didnâ€™t even bother helping me. How hard is it to reopen the gate when, whatâ€™s another 3 mins? This is my first time flying with Delta and definitely will be my last! Very poor service!"
727,2,11,June,2021,Economy Class,New York JFK , Mexico City     ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Fort Lauderdale to Boston. I do not particularly appreciate how Delta forced their clients to make their reservations online because the phone wait time is more than 6 hrs. When you finally add all the parties that will be on the flight, you are supposed to call in for individuals under the age of 2 to go free. Bear in mind that the long wait time. I wasted $206 on a ticket that was supposed to be free because my son is under the age of 2. The Delta representative informed me that error should have been corrected before I flew, even though I told them I tried fixing this error in the airport. Sorry Delta, your customer service quality is poor, especially when the flight is not cheap. The flight's television malfunctioned on our way back to Florida and the food that was provided to us was cheap. I had way better service in United Airlines. I guess I will think 3x before I fly with Delta again."

I was going for a girls trip and one of the events we planned on going to had been moved to the following weekend. So I had to change my flights, I contacted Southwest and had no problem getting things changed. Delta put me on a five hour wait, no one ever answered the phone, then I called back the following day they said they had a 20 hour wait to talk to customer service. After being on hold for 3 hours, I hung up and was never helped. Long story short I ended buying another return flight through Southwest and I never plann on giving Delta my business."

Flight from DCA was delayed due to JFK Flight restrictions, by the time we left and landed, connection to SJU was missed. Called Delta and was told to go to desk where supervisor would provide discounted hotel voucher since next Flight was 8am the next day. Delta supervisor scared me 2mins then told me he was not sure why I was told that because they can't offer me a voucher for weather delays. I call back Delta as 8am flight will not work for due to job requirements and was presented with a $300 fee to change the flight to a later time within the same day (within 24hr window). So I have to stay in JFK overnight and miss work so that Delta incurs no additional cost by adjusting a flight. Not sure if Delta has run a recent sentiment analysis from customer reviews but its trending negatively."

731,1,9,June,2021,Economy Class,Charleston , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta used to care about their customers and have great customer service. Now they donâ€™t! I understand weather delays, mechanical problems. But when no one will help you, or even look you in the eyes your frustration level goes up! Horrible customer service! Ready to cancel my skymiles card! Wonâ€™t be fling Delta again- sadly they donâ€™t care."
732,1,8,June,2021,Economy Class,Portland , Key West , La Guardia    ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I called this morning to talk to customer service and was told the wait would be 4 hours. Instead of waiting on-hold they had an option to call me back when it was my turn, i picked that option. Unfortunately, I never got a call back. I called tonight and waited on hold of 3 hours and 38 minutes before giving up. This is ridiculous that you cannot get ahold of anyone when you need to. I cannot believe they are ok with making be wait this long on hold to talk to someone. I am not impressed and may have to start using another airline. Delta clearly doesn't care about their customers."

I can't believe you expect people to wait on your incompetence for hours and hours, while we pay hundreds over what the normal fare usually is. I truly hate this experience and I haven't even gotten on the plane yet. Why can't you offer chat that actually works? This is 2021, not 1950! And if that isn't possible, how about an EMAIL option?? I have spent hours and so much phone battery life simply trying to talk to a human. You need to get your act together, Delta, and you need to do it now."
734,1,8,June,2021,Economy Class,New Orleans , Orlando       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  The cabin was hot! I do not understand it. On my flight from New York to Mexico City the cabin was hot for the entire flight. The little adjustable air vents barely produced any air at all. My flight from Mexico City home was half and half. The first half of the flight was even warmer than the flight down. The second half was bearable. I was wearing a summer weight blouse and skirt and did not need another layer. This is a big change since before covid. It used to be that when you opened the air vent, you felt air blowing on you. I was not alone in my perception."

Took a red eye flight home and the two flight attendants were the most loud, unprofessional, chatty staff Iâ€™ve ever experienced. They didnâ€™t have any concerns for the passengers and talked about their personals lives as if they were on their first date with each other. I know their life story, they were not quiet, they were just so involved with the friendship they connected with each other and no concern for the people around them. Sadly the woman has a marriage ring on but they were giggling and laughing like they would be together forever. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it or that rude. That canâ€™t possibly be protocol I had headphones in and that did not help. I paid for comfort seats and wasted my money. Terrible trip. Delta is going downhill from the reviews and the experience Iâ€™m seeing."

Itâ€™s the same bad reviews that have been going on for years with no changes. My flight was delayed for 3 hours because I guess Delta didnâ€™t think it would be busy on Memorial Day weekend at the near end of a pandemic and no one has gone anywhere for over a year. Poor unqualified managers are in charge of the new American business models, in which customer service is the least of their concern. Itâ€™s in almost every business now, with the exception of a few who are very successful. It reminds me of another airline years ago who had a sign at their check in counter which stated â€œ just because you have a ticket does not guarantee you will be on this flightâ€."
740,1,28,May,2021,Economy Class,Charlotte , Minneapolis        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  May 21st â€“ May 25th 2021, we flew to EYW from PWM with LGA as a stopover. Weâ€™d flown to Key West in FLA in October 2020 First Class and Tampa in January Comfort Plus, and loved both trips. What we didnâ€™t realize is that the planes weâ€™d be flying on this time around were smaller. 2 seats on one side, 1 on the other. There was no separation, which eliminated the â€œexclusiveâ€ feel weâ€™d enjoyed with our first trip. Additionally, there were no TV screens. On the December flight, we were able to watch entire feature films. Additionally, each of the four legs of the trip were different in terms of food or drink service. Leg 1 - PWM to LGA we were offered snack boxes in addition to water, drinks, etc. On the shorter LGA to EYW, we were not offered the boxes. On the return trip, no snack boxes were even offered. Added to the substantially downgraded â€œfirst classâ€ experience due to the smaller aircraft, this all contributes to an overall sloppy and inconsistent feel, that is to say, â€œYou never know what youâ€™re going to get until you get on boardâ€. On the leg back, we were looking forward to a couple of the new margaritas in the can. They were amazing, having discovered them on the way down. But, they only packed 2 cans for the whole trip for the plane, the attendant says this happens a lot. Weâ€™ve had similar experiences where we werenâ€™t able to get water because youâ€™d run out of the little 8 oz bottles. Thatâ€™s just unacceptable. (As a side note, an 8 oz bottle of water on a 2-3 hour flight offers little in the way of meaningful hydration. I generally ask for two for each of us. Perhaps a more practical size would be more appropriate?) At the Key West airport on the leg back to LGA, we were the last ones to board. Why? Because the young attendant did not call first class. When we asked about it, she said, â€œwell I called Diamond, thatâ€™s the same thing.â€ Well, no, itâ€™s not. This same attendant was very unhelpful when we asked her about boarding passes. On our last trip to KW we had to print boarding passes vs. using our mobile ones. She said she didnâ€™t really know, they prefer printed but that we should be able to use the mobile, well, can we use them or not? Finally, Iâ€™m hard of hearing. I understand that thereâ€™s not a lot that can be done because of the mask wearing mandates, but youâ€™ve really got to teach your employees how to make clear announcements. How to annunciate properly, speak reasonably slowly and loudly enough. Iâ€™ve never felt so discriminated in my life, having to ask people around me if youâ€™d said anything important. (Most of them didnâ€™t hear the announcements either). On the first leg from PWM to LGA there was one young lady who was wonderful. Every other attendant gave us the impression that we were a bother. So all in all, we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it on several fronts. We found little similarity between our December & January first class trips and this one. Weâ€™re seriously disappointed, and will be sure to ascertain what type of plane weâ€™ll be flying on and get clear on boarding and offerings. Additionally, as a direct result of our disappointment, we plan to book our next first class trip with either AA or United. Our $800+ price gave us less service and experience than a $200 SW flight."

I booked a flight this morning with miles and went to cancel later the same day well within the refund period. I was locked out of my account so couldn't cancel myself online. So I called customer service was put on hold for 7hrs. while on hold I tried calling other numbers - finally got someone who said she couldn't help me and was very rude. She gave me a number to call and said it was the sky miles people so I called it. Turns out it was the disability hotline and the representative chewed me out for calling the number. Both were rude and my issue still isn't resolved."
742,4,26,May,2021,Economy Class,St Thomas , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," My experience with Delta Air Lines from day one has been horrible. I've always flown Southwest but we had credits that we had to use because of the pandemic and they said we had to use them within a year. It took me 3 weeks to change my flight because there was an 8, 10 and 12 hours wait times on the telephone phone. Also, on the website, it says luggage fees may apply and when we get to the check-in area they tell us $90 for luggage fees, well they should have just said from the beginning luggage wasn't free. For the price, I paid for luggage, long wait times on the phone, and the poor customer service I could have flown Southwest with free luggage and cheaper fees, and good customer service. You think them knowing their wait times on the telephone is horrible, and all the bad reviews people have been leaving they would at least throw in the luggage for all the headache. Well, Delta Air Lines you have lost me as a customer and I fly frequently."
743,1,26,May,2021,Economy Class,Dothan , Madison , Atlanta      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I have yet to actually take my flight. But the experience leading up to it is just insanely ridiculous. My husband and I are going to Mexico for our anniversary. Using vouchers as our original trip was last year. I re-booked in February this year and from that point forward, it has been one disaster after another. They 'canceled' our flights and re-booked for much longer flight times. Got them switched to something more manageable. Then, they 'changed' our flights to extended layovers again. Paid extra for them to change the flights back to the original flights booked, just to have them tell me the departure flight was 'canceled' and they re-booked us for the same flying times, just an entire 24 hours later. Because losing 24 hrs of your vacation means nothing to them. When I called Delta again (and I am telling you, I have wasted over 15 hrs on hold with all of my phone calls to Delta), the customer service lady said that the flight was not canceled. It was just overbooked. I asked to speak with a manager/supervisor and was told there was none available at that time and then I couldn't get a time for when one would be available. Currently on hold for an hour to try and switch our return flight for 24 hrs later so I can still get my full 7 days of vacation in. But seriously, Delta. You have done me wrong this time and it is unappreciated and I will never fly with you again. You are not even trying to help. You're just giving my seats away for new paying customers and think that I don't care. Majorly disappointed."

While Delta representative were so rude, 2 upset customers in the line were yelled at by delta representative for asking questions, and on top of all this, they called the cops on an angry old man."
745,10,25,May,2021,Economy Class,Minneapolis , Honolulu        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,South Korea, Trip Verified ,"  I had a horrible interaction today with a Delta check-in employee and had to reschedule my international flight because delta's COVID testing policy differs from South Korea's actual government policy/that of every other airline. I wanted to file a complaint and the wait time to reach customer service is 6 hours? I used to hold Delta to a quality a step above other airlines but they are seriously slacking these days! For those interested, I was held at check-in and missed my flight even though I arrived 2 hours early because the check-in person didn't realize I was a Korean citizen and not a foreign traveler. As an aside, Delta's policy for flights to South Korea is ridiculous and doesn't follow the actual government guidelines. Their policy is COVID test results have to be within 72 hours of the departure flight so a test at 8AM on 5/21 would not count for a flight at 10AM on 5/24 even if it is the same 3 days. The Korean government policy is that the 72 hours resets at 12AM every day so it shouldn't matter what the hour of day it is. From the Korean government website: ""The test needs to be issued no more than 72 hours before the departure date. *For example, for travelers whose flight departed on May 10, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., documents issued on or after May 7, 2021 (past 0:00) will be accepted."" That is how every other airline like Korean Airline honors the testing. I will be flying Korean air from now on."

747,1,24,May,2021,Economy Class,Iron Mountain , Denver , Detroit     ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I'm so disappointed in the terrible customer care I received on my recent delta flight. First, on the Delta email confirmation after purchasing my child's ticket, it clearly stated that we got a carry on AND checked bag (50lbs/23kil) Free for them. When trying to check in, the gate attendant first said we got NO checked bag for the child's ticket & after talking about it a while, they said, Oh actually you do get a checked bag, but it has totally different dimensions than a normal checked bag, and it can only be 10lbs. All of this info, even though our email confirmation did not only NOT say that, but said that we should get a 50lb bag for FREE. On a call after the fact while filing a complaint about the issues with the flight and trying to explain my experience as a customer, the representative spent the whole time contracting me and his/herself. And even though they (and all the other Delta people I had talked to in my experience checking in and boarding - everyone contracted themselves regularly) didn't know all the info, they told me I should have known because somehow the information was clear ... to everyone... and it was my fault for not knowing the rules? So people working for Delta couldn't figure it out every time I talked to someone after arriving to the airport, but it was definitely the customer's fault for not knowing? Bad customer experience on all levels. Great job, Delta. Tell us one thing in your direct communication about the flight and then hide the info that contracts that info, and then tell the customer they are the problem...?! Really? I'll be going with a different airline next time."
748,3,22,May,2021,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Our flight was grounded due to a maintenance issue which was understandable. However, after being deplaned with minimal explanation, the 1pm flight was rescheduled for 4pm. A few minutes later it was announced that the flight was rescheduled yet again and would be departing at 630pm. When several passengers inquired about the reason for a 5.5 hour delay, the gate agents wouldnâ€™t disclose any information. How is it possible that an airline the size of Delta has absolutely zero backup plan in place? It is unacceptable that an alternative aircraft could not be arranged in less than 5.5 hours. Delta endlessly boasts of its excellent service and on-time arrivals but they certainly donâ€™t deliver. After two similar past experiences I was compelled to leave a review. I will not be flying Delta again."
749,1,22,May,2021,Premium Economy,Omaha , Gulfport , Atlanta      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  It is impossible to get anyone from Delta on the telephone! Their ticketing procedure has become very confusing with hidden / additional fees for seats in the main cabin. The last time I flew there three additional fees tacked on to the basic ticket price. I tried calling Delta about these changes to my credit card and spent over 3 hours trying to talk to someone. I have flown on Delta for many years. But my last two trips (one in March 2021 and one in April 2021) and my upcoming trip (May 2021) have me wondering if I should find a different airline. Air travel has become very expensive and being unable to speak to someone when I need to is extremely frustrating.
750,2,17,May,2021,Economy Class,Edinburgh , New York       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I think its time we all hold Delta accountable for their lack of communication. In my opinion they are the best for price, comfort, and safety, but it is impossible to get someone on the phone. I get it, who needs any help booking a flight? but when your flight gets delayed and then an hour later is on time you can find yourself in a tough situation. This situation is not the first time its happened but the communication has never improved, we were notified at 3pm that our 6.40 flight was delayed till 8.30, but being 1.5 hours from the airport we were in the cab, so we went back to the hotel. 30 minutes later we received a text that our flight was on time, so now we are cutting close to get back to the airport. 5 hour hold time to call someone. At the airport we were told flight is delayed till 10 but we needed to be there at the original time to get thru customs, ok but how about putting that in the text. When they finally cancelled the flight they told us the original flight would leave at 10.15 but stop in Atlanta. Atlanta was experiencing tornados, so being stuck in Atlanta didn't seem like a good option, so we rebooked at the same time the next day, only to find out an hour later that the 10:15 flight was non-stop to JFK. Again we tried to call, I'm still on hold its been 8 days. I spent years traveling discount airlines before I could appreciate the value of quality over price, but the stress of Delta's customer service is forcing me to look at other airlines."
751,1,15,May,2021,First Class,Honolulu , Minneapolis        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This was my first time flying Delta and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed. On my flight to Alabama I noticed the flight attendants were giving out free alcohol to the few people who asked for it, and they just said to leave them a good review, I didn't ask for any at the time because I wasn't prepared to pay for airplane vodka and I wasn't sure, but on my return flight I figured I'd go for it because I was feeling anxious and if it was free, why not? But I asked, and the lady came back, handed me the bottle, and asked for a credit card. I was taken aback, and had to reach down under the seat where my purse was, and the stupid cart was in the way so I bumped my head, the lady was very rude and uncaring, and it was just a terrible experience because the attendants were so nice on my flight down here but they were just so rude on my flight back home. Seriously doubting I'll ever fly Delta again."

Although the aircraft was the same type, this flight was much better. Covid has created a lack of quality control and it is no ones fault. I will say that although the previous crew was fine, this group is a little sunnier and more interactive. Also the food and amenity kit are far superior out of Minneapolis. The seat is still not fantastic but it is fine and I would choose this over a regular first class flight."

One Cabin stewardess had a bad attitude, rude and condescending. She and her partner stewardess gossiped loudly about passengers. Talked over PA announcements. Rude and condescending to my 81-year-old husband who had medical issues. Twice had to tell him to put up his mask. Second time she said this is the second time Iâ€™ve had to tell you to pull up your mask she couldâ€™ve done it without embarrassing him by now she mustâ€™ve had some kind of kind way to remind passengers.

756,1,12,May,2021,Economy Class,Las Vegas , Minneapolis       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," The flight attendants on flight DL1329 were awful. They have the worst customer service I have ever seen on a flight. I was flying with my 3 kids, ages 3, 5 and 10. We all had face masks on, however with talking to toddlers and chewing food the mask would fall below our noses. The attendant spoke to me about my 5 year olds mask, and we fixed it. Shortly later I received a â€œfinal warningâ€ and was told a red coat would remove me from the flight. They also made this announcement to the entire flight threatening to be removed like criminals. A group of 6 young men were sitting behind us, and before even leaving the gate the male attendant told them they would be removed if they gave him any problems. They were doing nothing wrong. Those boys also told the â€œred coatâ€ that the attendant never spoke to me aside from the one time about my 5 year old. The attitudes over masks slipping down is ridiculous. Even if I were spoken to, they acted like I threw a fit and refused to wear a mask completely when I in fact had the mask on the entire time. The attendant also rammed the snack cart into a womanâ€™s leg/arm rest several times to push past. I have flown Jetblue since Covid and had no problems, I had no problems going from Boston to Florida on Delta. This crew was just awful. The â€œred coatâ€ they made out to be an evil person ready to throw me in prison, was very nice and understanding even when the attendant butted into our conversation after the boys behind me said I wasnâ€™t spoken to. She said â€œwe also spoke to the boys multiple times tooâ€. I didnâ€™t see her talk to them at all about their mask falling under their noses."

There was a female Delta assistant sitting at the gate and answering questions for customers. Her attitude was one like the customers were bothering her and she didnâ€™t want to put much effort into helping them or speaking up. She appeared annoyed with me and two customers before me. I then observed her looking at her cell phone and not long after, she departed the area. It is stressful enough for travelers during this time to have employees of a respected airlines not want to do the job they are paid to do, and to come off with an attitude of indifference.

758,4,8,May,2021,First Class,Seattle , Rapid City       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Verified ,"  Bait and switch from Delta. Booked in March 2021 from Edinburgh to New York on a direct flight at 10.30am, taking about 7 hours. I live 20 minutes from the airport and I chose Delta because it was a direct flight. These are difficult to get from Scotland as BA does not route a single flight from Scotland to the USA. You have to go via Heathrow. First May email comes saying not only am I now leaving at 6.00am in the morning instead of 10.30 but from Edinburgh to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to New York - 15.5 hours. Delta fly daily from Edinburgh to JFK and while I understand they might have cancelled some of them due to Covid I did not expect them to cancel every, single flight. Every, single, day. I was quite surprised because when I tried to book by seats quite few were already taken. So many people have been inconvenienced. I had booked on the premise that if Scotland was shafted yet again as the easy option, they would fly me from another airport, one within the UK. They fly from Heathrow on both Delta operated flights and code share with Virgin too. But they routed me backwards via Amsterdam. Nine hours after I left the house for my 20 minute trip to the airport, I would be back over UK airspace again, right back to where I started.  They would not put me any of the Heathrow flights because they would have to pay BA to fly me there from Edinburgh and they do not code share with them.  They would not give me my money back because I am not American. US law means they have to refund American citizens if they cancel flights with no comparable alternative but as they advised me, they can pretty much do what they want with others. No legal requirement to compensate me or route me even from the same country. I could rebook but they would keep my money until I did. For a year. Then they would keep it all.  So, I had to cancel and rebook from Heathrow and pay the cost of getting myself a return flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Apart from the totally inconvenient flight times and flight changes from direct to indirect flights and 2 set sets of immigration to queue up for, I had no wish to have to check if 2 countries still had their borders open to UK citizens until 22nd June. If you live in the EU then Book with European airline in these uncertain times. EU law would have ensured that not only would a full refund be forthcoming, but 600 euro would have to be paid in compensation. UK has kept this part of EU law. Shame on you Delta, shame on you."

This was the worst Delta One seat Iâ€™ve ever had. Getting in and out was laborious. Once in, it was comfortable though. Due to Covid, service was greatly reduced although a hot meal (all on one tray) was served. Honestly the food was bad. Itâ€™s hard to understand blaming Covid restrictions for quality. Flight attendants were great but had a horrible product to offer. Breakfast was inedible and I wasnâ€™t the only one inquiring as to what the mess was (they called it grits). We arrived on time and, of course safely but the offerings are not going to convince people to fly let alone buy a premium ticket. Disappointing."
760,10,6,May,2021,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Kona       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked with Delta through hotwire. I had never used Delta before but it was the only airline that didn't have a 6am return flight. I was traveling with my boyfriend and 3 yr old son. First, I booked the flight and car. All the funds were pending. When it actually charged my card, I noticed it was 1 plane ticket less. I thought maybe they changed something due to my son's age, cool. So I questioned whether he would be allowed a carryon or not. The website says its based on price. Seeing as to how I wasn't sure what happened with the ticket prices, I figured I'd call to find out. I spent 9 HOURS to ask this simple question. 5 hours on hold waiting for someone to answer before I gave up, and 4 hours trying to use the online chat. Finally, I got someone, gave them the ticket number (which I figured they would say something if they missed the charge), they said yes to the carry on. Then we get to the airport. We're carrying our bags, a carseat, a stroller and a child. We were rushed through everything as if we were an inconvenience (ok whatever). We get to the gate and wait. Then our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue with the a/c. For 2+ hours. We missed our connecting flight in Atlanta. At this point I'm stressed, but think ""better safe than sorry, things happen"". Flight back: again, rushed through security. Get to the gate. Wait. Another delay. Mechanical issue with the a/c unit. What are the chances? Again, waiting hours to get on the plane and missing our connecting flight home. Here's the kicker, it was the last flight from Minneapolis to Milwaukee that day so we were not getting home. They searched for options and said we can maybe get you on tomorrow but all of tomorrow's flights are booked up so we'll put you on standby and hopefully you get something. They put us in a hotel in Minneapolis for the night. I had thrown away a bunch of stuff that I didn't think we needed anymore; toothbrushes, toothpaste, trial sizes of deodorant, all of the toiletries. So we had none of that. Ok now we go to the airport again to see if we can get on a plane. They luckily said yes, gave us tickets. We wait. They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself. Finally, an attendant on the plane helped me switch seats with another rider so my toddler didn't have to sit with a stranger. We got home and I was just relieved to have it all over with. Then I check my bank account 5 days later and Delta charged me another $438.40!"

This seat was not being used. It caused a minimum of 10 passengers to miss their international connections. Including myself and my significant other.. The longer we sat there the more people deplaned, the more they had to wait to remove their checked luggage. We lost an entire vacation package we prepared for a year in advance over this stupid seat issue. It was the only flight going out all day. My first international trip ruined by Delta. Your measly $250 voucher won't pay for my lost $3k trip."
762,2,5,May,2021,Economy Class,Kiev , Oklahoma , Paris / Atlanta    ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  I will never fly Delta again. Iâ€™ve been a loyal Delta customer for years. I purchase three tickets on my credit card with my skymiles number. I tried to cancel one of the flights after being on hold for nearly 20 hours in a single week! Then end result was the Delta customer service supervisor saying that the ticket is non-refundable and non-transferable. I did not buy a basic economy ticket. They are treating me like I bought the cheapest ticket I could on Expedia. Iâ€™ve had better experiences with Spirit Airlines. What a terribly run corporation. There are too many travel options to treat customers this way.

First of all, they delayed my departure flight weeks before my trip. I was able to move to an earlier flight so that I can still be able to work in the morning. Second, Delta delayed my arrival flight right when I got myself to the airport by an hour. Then further kept delaying it to the point that I sat around in the airport of 5 hours waiting. Delta delayed enough resulting in me having to change to a new connecting flight. Flight DL2525 somehow still managed to arrive late compared to its new stated time. Nobody was surprised. Finally, this major delay resulted in me having about 20 mins to get to my connecting flight. I took the shuttle and run across the airport. The gate is open and people are in line. I think Iâ€™m in luck. I ask the attendant to allow me in she says â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€ and tells the attendant â€œclose the gateâ€. I truly had the door slammed in my face. I still havenâ€™t arrived to my location and who knows what hoops Iâ€™ll have to jump to get eventually home. Delta needs to get organized until then I will need pure luck to get home."

The people working for the airline decided to make us wait until we couldn't make our flight and then told us we had to buy all new tickets. Talk about greed. My wife or I could have at least made the other flight so we wouldn't have had to buy all new tickets. Unbelievable. This is not the way to treat your customers Delta.

It was a full flight. Delta flight crew keeps announcing that they are implementing the federal mask mandate but during our flight, there were many people with masks down. The passenger seated next to me only put his mask on for only 30 minutes during the entire 2.5 hours flight. Other passengers around us also were not wearing masks during the flight. The Detroit based flight crew just kept passing by these non-masked passengers without telling them to put on their masks. They were just turning a blind eye on passengers who do not want to put on their masks. We felt very unsafe during the flight. Delta flight crew does not really care about health & safety of their customers especially during this time of pandemic."

My flight was delayed by 2 hours with an email the night before at 10pm when i was due to travel at 530am. When i landed on Detroit i was told my 2nd flight was already gone. So i was stuck there for 3 hours. Then they finally found me a flight from Detroit to Minnesota. Then i had to wait 7 hours at the Minnesota airport for my next flight to Kansas. The people were rude and not very verbal. No sense of compassion. I will never travel through them again specially in my condition.

Realizing I would be paying more for a flight that had a shorter layover and better departure times, I paid for the higher priced flight. But guess what? Delta modified my flight to have a 3 hour layover instead of the one hour and instead of leaving at 12:45PM, I am getting up at 0-dark-thirty to catch my early flight because Delta decided to carve a huge portion of time out of my vacation to suit their needs. My favorite part is the 7 hour wait for their customer service. What garbage this airline is. I'm cancelling my AMEX which I use to earn Delta miles and going somewhere else."

We were supposed to be leaving this morning to visit and pick up his car. Our flight was scheduled for take off at 7.40am. Well I'm at work and I get a text that says my flight to ATL, GA has been canceled due to inclement weather. Ok fine so I go search for other available flights, there's none. Ok how are we going to see my son and spend time with him before he leaves the country? I called Delta customer service line and the recording stated the hold time would be just under 2 hours, I've currently been on hold for 4 hours and still holding. This is absolutely ridiculous. I want a refund and I want to tell you how you have ruined my trip! I will never fly Delta again. This airline already has a very bad reputation anyways and I see why. You should be ashamed of yourself for the inconvenience this has caused me and my family. Now we'll have to drive there and back."

I've called 5 times to change my flight day to no avail. Wait time 4 to 5 hours. Sometimes they don't even give a wait time so I hang on the line for a half hour and finally give up. When I try to go onto their website, it doesn't work either with my name and password. I expect Delta will soon go the way of PSA and Continental as has-beens'. Good riddance when it happens. I'll never fly them again."

They initially had amazing customer service. Now, most attendants are rude, demeaning passengers and even stating, ""we've been doing this long enough, wear your masks right"". In their initial announcements. I tried to upgrade my seat and was advised, in a very rude tone, none were available though online showed 9 in comfort and 1 in first class. I said thank you and she just stared at me. I told her, ""you are welcome, thats what you tell people"". I have one flight left next week. I guess I will be spending my thousands of dollars per year on another airline."

Trip out was nice. On the trip back we discovered that Delta had changed my flight but not hers. I assumed that the entire flight was â€˜rescheduledâ€™ and we had been transferred together, but no, they had randomly changed my flight but not hers, no reason why. Delta did finally get us on the same flight, but not in the same row as had been confirmed two months earlier, so we still didnâ€™t get to spend time together. Customer service has basically said, â€œtoo bad, how sadâ€, weâ€™ll give you a gift card and maybe the difference in seating upgrade and baggage fees, nothing confirmed. Does not make up for the time we had hoped to spend together. We see each other every couple years or so, so it was a big deal to spend time together, but that does not seem to matter to customer service. Iâ€™m not likely to fly Delta again, and certainly will not trust any so-called confirmations from them."
772,1,16,April,2021,Economy Class,San Francisco , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"   So my wife and I had the worst nightmare of experience in KBP, our flight to Paris was changed from Delta operated by Ukrainian airline. When we arrived in KBP they told us they cant find our electronic tickets and made us pay 250 EUR for registration and ticket processing which is outrageous considering our trip was paid for and final. On top of that they made us pay $440 EUR for our one checked luggage and 1 carry on item per person which is covered by our tickets we purchased. So as you would imagine not the best experience flying with Delta having paid for tickets and having to pay even more money especially because none of this stuff is actually valid.  Sadly we were not alone and there were many other outraged customers who were affected and I am sure it will reflect on them flying with Delta in the future. But anyways they were refusing to let us board unless we pay."

I was placed in the 'we are so busy we will have to call you back queue' and was finally contacted via text on the third night. This is just unacceptable. I have almost flown Delta exclusively my entire life and this experience is really making me start to look at other options, Delta you are better than this or you used to be. Itâ€™s really a shame at how bad you service has become."
774,1,11,April,2021,Economy Class,Memphis , Greensboro        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ," Never again Delta. Today I arrived at PWM at 5am for my 6.30 flight. The Flight was delayed for fog in NY, not a problem I wasn't in a rush to get to CLE but just needed to get there hopefully by 5pm and even later would have been ok. Delay after delay after delay after delay came and went. They called me up and said that the connecting flight was in jeopardy but that they might make up time in the air and I might be ok, but they offered me a alternative to go to Detroit and then to Cleveland on a later flight, said they would put me on it and I could decide before the boarding of the one that might be late into NY. I said ok, fine. 2 minutes later they said they couldn't get me that because someone took the seat they had for me and it was the last one. OK, I figure well, at least I get to New York and surely Delta will get me to Cleveland, both being large cities. So the original flight delays more and more and they they find me again and say...we know you have been here for a very long time Sir, but we can't get you to Cleveland today""? What an epic failure for a supposedly professional company, a large carrier, the kind someone might book with and book first class because they are known as a reliable company! Don't be fooled, they are none of that if they cannot get a passenger to a city like Cleveland Ohio on a day they ticket you for. Not a holiday, not a busy time of year, nope, just a bungling company with terrible service that can't deliver on their service. This day cost me two uber riders to and from my home, it cost me food all day while I waited and waited being promised time and time again the flight would be leaving, I think a total of 6 times before I was told to take a hike because I wasn't making my trip today, I was told I could book with another airline and that they were out at this point. I could get a refund for my unfulfilled ticket by Delta. Of course when I asked that would my having to rebook on another airline today at a hugely inflated last minute ticket, would they include that on my refund, they were not taking any responsibility for that. Just go away sir and have a nice day. The only thing that went well at all, was the refund person that answered the phone in a reasonable amount of time and was very nice while quickly refunding my card. So apparently they do well at refunds, likely due to lots of practice! I always thought Delta was one of the top dogs in the industry, I mean I would have not been surprised if they were a small company like Elite, Spirit or Frontier, but Delta? They can't fix a screw up delay to a city like Cleveland? So I had to go home and not make a trip to do business for a couple of days because I chose a company like Delta, because I chose to trust my flight need to Delta. What a mistake, one that I will never make again."

776,1,9,April,2021,Economy Class,Minneapolis , Memphis        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ,"  Delta Airlines has the worst customer service. Whatever issues you have, go unaddressed because they have ensured you never get them addressed. I wanted to change my name on the ticket, so I went to their website as they indicated because you can't talk to a real person. I never heard from them to confirm they received my form. I called and was on hold twice for an hour (estimated wait time 3 hours). I wrote customer service and an automated response directed to the same website. They act like they are going to answer a text on their app but that's a computer responding and it doesn't understand anything related to a conversation and keeps directing you to their website. So now I'm at risk of not being able to fly internationally next week because no one is responding. I will never ever fly Delta after this."

They were professional, friendly and warm. They were fantastic. The stewardess in the back where I was seated was dismayed that she didnâ€™t have any stickers for a four-year-old child. On the way out she arranged for the pilot to give the child a pin with the Delta wing symbol on it. It was over and beyond and I hope they can be complemented."
778,3,5,April,2021,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  I flew with Delta yesterday from Raleigh to Fort Myers via Atlanta. First flight was pretty relative of the Delta experience: Nice staff, comfortable seat, social distancing (as I booked the 3 side on the 717), and overall good flight. The 717 does not have IFE screens but I brought my own entertainment and the flight was only about an hour so it did not really matter anyway. My second flight, unfortunately, wasn't quite the same. Delta, without any notice or email or compensation or anything, put someone in the middle seat between me and my mom. All 3 of us were confused as Delta has a policy to not do this, so we consulted the gate agent who was more than happy to re-seat her since there was a few no-shows. However, this should not have happened in the first place. Normally my experiences on Delta are 10/10 but unfortunately this was just not the same. Some flight attendants on the 2nd flight also seemed a bit cranky and not happy to be there, though some were very nice as well. Overall, indifferent experience, could've been improved with some notice about the middle seat situation. I understand it is ending in a month but still, when you say the middle seat will be blocked, it should be blocked, end of story."

As we were getting off the plane I asked the Captain if I could get a picture of me in the cockpit. He let me sit in the left seat, the greatest seat in the world. I'm 52 years old and had/have a grin like a little kid getting a gift he's always wanted. The flight was DL2534, 4/3/21. If the Captain of this flight sees this, Thank you  so much for letting me sit in your seat.  My biggest regret is not being an airline pilot. Thank you Delta and the Captain of this flight."

Me and my soon to be wife were flying to Las Vegas to get married. It was a dinner flight and I expected to get some dinner. However because me and my wife were sitting up in the very front we were the last ones to get served. When it came time to order our food there was no food left. Another passenger gave up their food so I let my wife eat it. I've never felt so disrespected in my life. The flight attendant was actually rude to me for the fact I was mad. I spent over $1000 each ticket for one way because I was buying a car there in Vegas to drive back. They never apologized to me or shown any gratitude. I will never fly Delta again.

We were unable to choose seats when we booked online. I called and asked for a call back. They promised within 20 minutes. 1 and half hours later they would not allow us to make sure the 5 and 12 year olds could not sit with their mother. Argumentative and rude customer service!!!! We have to wait and hope we can get seats together 24 hours before their flight. Unacceptable.

I am the paying customer, she is the employee giving me the rude behavior, when I spent thousands on this first class plane ticket."
783,1,12,March,2021,Premium Economy,Amsterdam , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Delta is normally my backup airline. But it became my primary during the pandemic. I was moving from OKC to Denver, so this was a one way flight. Although there were nonstop flights to Denver I could've taken out of OKC, I chose Delta regardless if I had to take two flights to get to my destination cause they still had social distant seating on all their flights. Which made me feel comfortable since it'd be my first time flying since the pandemic started. Check in at OKC wasn't a hastle. Since I have a Gold Card, they still accepted my bag even though it was a few pounds over the limit. At the gate, I spoke to the agent handling boarding about the precautions. She was very nice and descriptive about their cleanliness and cleaning procedures. She was kind enough to give me a goodie bag filled with cookies, sanitizing wipes and a thank you post card. Flight to SLC from boarding to landing was ontime, smooth and pleasant. Connection at SLC was a little surprising. I learned we'd be deplaning at a remote spot and be bussed to the terminal due to construction I wasn't aware they were doing on some of the terminals. When we deplaned, we had to share two buses with another flight that had just arrived. Both buses ended up being at full capacity. Meaning we weren't able to social distance for the entire bus ride. In this environment, that was dangerous to do. I feel Delta could've done a better job mitigating this issue. Afterwards, the rest of the connection was fine. Boarded, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants on the flight were nice enough to let me move to an empty row because of my discomfort of sharing a row with another passenger, even though the middle seat was open. Overall, great experience with Delta in a pandemic. If they could just be more cautious about their remote stand connection process, that would be best. I have plans to fly Delta again in a month while they still have their social distant seating arrangement. Looking forward to it and experiencing a different connection process in SLC. Thanks Delta!"

I so appreciate that Delta has chosen to keep the middle seat open to keep comfort and safety a priority. The crew has had to put up with a lot of pushback and I again appreciate how gracious their approach has been to navigate through this delicate climate. From the captains reminding passengers of the current rules to the crew politely reminding us that enforcing them is a requirement, it has been a year of travel facilitated by the hard working Delta employees. Thank you for allowing me to continue working without having to worry about my safety. You are appreciated."

I booked a flight for a female friend and she been around someone at work that has covid-19. She has to quarantine for 14 days so she can't visit. Delta want reimburse me and only give credit for her. I paid for the ticket so credit should be for me too use also because no telling when or if she will be able too visit now. I fly all the time. I wish I would've stuck with American Airlines. I had a problem lily this last year. They credit my card back. This a pandemic and Delta don't care.
787,10,14,February,2021,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Cancun       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  I was mistreated and baffled by the lack of professionalism the staff had towards me. Every conversation I had with a Delta representative left me feeling upset and hurt. I needed to change my return flight due to some weather problems and I had to talk to 2 different people but call back 3 times because halfway through our conversation the line would randomly cut out for me to never get a call back. When I would call back I would get the same representative who would sound surprised when I called back. They never gave us much confirmation and were all over the place trying to figure out how to change my flight. I am overall not happy with how Delta have treated me. It was not even one person it was multiple staff at the airport and with representatives on the phone.
788,2,7,February,2021,Economy Class,Cancun , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  They had a â€œmaintenance issueâ€ with some battery part missing on the plane (youâ€™d think they would check further in advance than right as soon as we boarded the plan). They had to fly in another part for the aircraft and had us wait for several hours on the plane and then de board and wait several more. They had one ticket agent help to rearrange connecting flights so we stood in line for hours while they tried to rebook. My flight was unable to be rebooked through delta so I had to book an entirely new flight which they did not cover the cost. Terrible experience. This is the second time theyâ€™ve had a maintenance issue. And within a few days of each other. Very unprofessional, rude staff."

I called to fix something on my itinerary and was talked to very snappily, rudely, and the lady was very short with me. She talked to me as if I was completely ignorant, like she had no time for me, and like I was way beneath her. I love flying with Delta but this frustrated me so much that I will definitely be reconsidering for my future flights. Iâ€™ve never understood why people get a job within customer service if they canâ€™t even pretend to be nice humans. This was definitely a conversation that could have easily been talked through. I wasnâ€™t complaining or being a pain - just had to fix a minor detail on my ticket-nothing crazy. Disappointed for sure. "

No other airline matches their level of service online, at the gate, and in the cabin. Customer Service texting has added another higher level of service to Delta customers.

I was supposed to leave at 1655 today. I am still in Tampa and donâ€™t even know if I will have a connecting flight from Atlanta to Memphis. Delta staff has argued that I didnâ€™t pay for a first class ticket when I give them my confirmation number and show pic of ticket. I donâ€™t know what else I can show. The woman that changed my ticket said to call for a refund and  wonâ€™t give me one and everyone has been so incredibly rude. Delta are saying you canâ€™t refund me and I canâ€™t sit in first class and I have been delayed four or five times.

I just flew out of Logan in Boston this afternoon. I traveled via Delta to return to work in southern Cal after spending the holidays in the Boston area with my family. I'm a military service member, in the last 7 years, I traveled 4-5 times a year to ferry back and forth home, often using Delta. This is the first and hopefully, last time that I have been treated in such a horrible way by a ticket counter agent. I arrived with my dad and fiancee and from the moment we approached the counter, she consistently and relentlessly spoke to us like we children in an angry and dismissive tone of voice and manner. We were so confused about why we were being treated so poorly, we remained silent about her behavior, not wanting a confrontation because we didn't want to be delayed or delay those in line behind us. We were looking for additional assistance, she dismissed us by saying ""this is a ticket counter, all I do is check back.. move to the side, wait for a supervisor if you have other questions"" There is no way I'm using (or recommending anyone I know) to use Delta Airlines after this experience. If a ticket agent feels so empowered to treat a customer this way, there must be a systematic problem at that Boston station."

I reported the incident at the baggage counter. I was instructed to go online and provide pictures and information. When I went online I was required to have an incident report. Absolutely incompetent personnel at the baggage claim counter did not provided me one. Then the nightmare started when after countless e-mails with customer service I was offered a voucher for future flights because I wasnâ€™t able to provide my original receipt as it was a gift from my sister-in-law. I explained I do not need to flight Delta anymore .. what I do need is to buy a New stroller for my baby. Absolutely horrible service.

But when I got there, they were irritated and clearly upset about working under those conditions. 2) I got stuck in a special TSA line and they went through every article in my purse and laptop bag. Something on my boarding pass, I presume? (Note, I am TSA Pre-Check approved but it was not on my boarding pass.) 3) I start boarding at the gate and the gate attendant charges me for my pet bag. In fact, she charged me more for a bag that sits under the seat than I paid for my entire flight! Toddlers are free and they cry the whole flight but a dog in a bag under the seat costs more than an adult person does?! Ridiculous! To make matters worse, the seats are so cramped that the bag hardly fits. (It fit great with Alaska Airlines!) Delta..get a clue! If you want to be a premiere airline, think about how you treat people, staff, passengers, and pets!"

Opodo advertises everywhere that they are waiving the changing fees for flights but when I called they simply said they won't do it and the lady hung up. Then I tried again and the next person said they will transfer me and after waiting for 20 minutes the call got disconnected. Next time, they said they will send me a cost calculation the next day and then I received an email saying they will not make any changes. How can it be this hard to change a flight? I have been trying for several hours and it was the same again and again. I am baffled how a big company like Delta can get away with this and will never fly with Delta again."

I was flying from MEM to ATL (final destination ORF) after being seated I realized I had lost my right AirPod (a Mother's Day gift from my daughter). I tell you the entire flight crew went over and above the call of duty, to locate my lost item. They made an announcement, they asked other passengers if they had seen it and would they look under their seats, they went back into the terminal area, they walked the walk way several times; everyone from the Head Flight Specialist to those assisting in the back were in on the search. But when the young lady got down on her knees and started searching, well words can not express my gratitude. So, would like to thank each and everyone of them. And yes the Young Lady that, in a skirt got down on her knees to look, she did find the AirPod, it had dropped between my row 13 and row 14. Yes, we had an on time departure."

So well over 6 months ago. The flight got changed to a later departure time which put arrival time into JAX pretty late. Delta switched my child's ticket to SAV airport for the person picking her up at no charge. So less travel time for my child and less drive time. The man I spoke with was very kind and prompt. I have read bad reviews on them but my experience was great and I will continue to give Delta my business. Thank you for switching her arrival airport.

They cancelled around 500 flights over Thanksgiving, including my flight to New Orleans twice. They did not rebook the 2nd time, just left me stranded one day before Thanksgiving. Their website did not allow refund for their cancellation so I had to spend hours on hold for a partial refund, and it ruined my trip. They are despicable."

The luggage fees were painful though, I have 2 checked in pieces of luggage which amounted to $85.00 one way. I hope Delta could come up with something to ease the burden on International flights for passengers. Upon boarding flight attendants handed a one time use hand sanitizer, snacks was provided plane was very clean and smells fresh they really mean the word ""Sanitizing"" flight was smooth no issues with fellow passengers.

I loved the way Delta blocks the middle seat not for my convenience but for an extra layer of safety. Kudos Delta but please do something with your luggage fees, I'm loving the way you take safety in another level but the luggage fees hurts."

Yes we cut it close, this airport is beyond confusing, but the one in Arkansas let her board 10 minutes before take off for unforeseen issues. Delta needs to hire more decent and competent staff. The second she saw me she dismiss me and then throughout the rest of the interaction antagonize me until I exploded and then of course and have any time to board the plane. I have flown so many times and I have dealt with so many different circumstances like this or much better and I've never in my life encountered someone so rude unaccommodating and unprofessional I don't even know why she's there unless this is just what Delta does now."

If she was my employee she would be terminated instantly. She spoke down to me when I didn't understand her policy on cancellation versus the one on the website. She then put me on hold twice without notice in the middle of me speaking. The Delta website is utter trash. The chat support wasn't working. Can't leave a complaint via your complaint submission page on this site. Just errors out both times I tried to submit one. Can't even leave a message via the Facebook Message option they mention here. It just redirects you to their support page on their site which is also broken. All you can do is call. Get with the times already. I have been loyal to Delta but it is very one-sided. I will be switching my loyalty elsewhere.

As soon as I sat down I was helping my kids get their seat belts on. During the reaching around my masked slipped a bit down my nose. I was startled when a very young flight attendant very rudely and sharply said that my mask had to stay all the way to the top of my nose for the entire flight. It was not what she said but how she said it. My flight was 5 hours delayed and this was at 6 hour flight at 4 in the morning. Then she woke me up twice because my mask had slipped a little down while I was asleep. I walked to the bathroom and clearly saw 6 or more people with masks completely off. I felt targeted. My 10 year old asked me why that flight attendant seemed out to get me. I have traveled during Covid many times. I have never experienced such a rude, heartless, unsympathetic flight attendant. My family and I were doing the best we could. Second time she woke me up, she threatened to have police meet my family at the gate. This is a ridiculous abuse of authority from a power hungry child who should clearly not be in the service industry. I was nothing but kind saying I was sorry, I was sleeping and it slipped down a bit. She made me extremely uncomfortable the entire flight."

The day before I had called Delta Airlines at Midway and the lady had said it was ok after providing my Global Entry number. So I complained at the boarding gate. The Delta response was: It was the fault of TSA, and it had probably to do with my last name being hyphenated. After that I called TSA in Midway, and the lady over the phone told me that I had failed to ask for the Airline to resubmit my reservation. Honestly, I had never heard of that resubmission before, and I have used my Global entry before many times. At that moment, I was really upset. What is the point of paying for Global entry then? By the way, the treatment by the TSA staff at the security gate was horrible. Please, avoid Delta and the Midway airport if you can."

We were told military families were Delta's priority, that they would take the upmost care of us and our dog, this is just marketing clap trap, we were treated with utter destain. The whole nightmare was two days of shear hell. We were told Delta had a one time fee of $200 to ship our pet yet they demanded almost $1,000 when we were in the cargo warehouse. Delta has a good marketing campaign, in reality they treat military families like trash. Our family did not deserve what they did to us."

Flew to Seattle on Hawaiian and received a hot meal and cocktails. For a premium price Delta offered water, cheap wine, or beer only. No alcohol, no ice, no soda or juice. Food was an embarrassing box/bag with cheap snacks. All this on a 6 hour flight. Inexcusable. Flight attendants were constantly offering so cabin presence wouldâ€™ve been the same.

I asked the person who recorded my face if they would block out my person, and he said ""are you kidding"" when I brought it up to the flight attendant the captain asked if my husband and I had a problem and would like to Deboard the plane, I did nothing wrong. The person invading my privacy was not asked to deboard, was not asked to delete the video, and I will never fly Delta again because my privacy is my safety! Not just my health."

Flight DL 1030, I checked my Delta App and in it Terminal C was listed. I arrived at Terminal C at 0630, I was then told by a Delta employee that I was at the wrong Terminal, they stated I had to walk, to go down stairs and walk to terminal D. So I struggled with my luggage and made it to terminal D at 0645. As I checked the flight board I did not see my flight so I went into Delta Sky and asked for assistance. The young lady scanned my app and told me I was in the wrong terminal, she stated that I had to go to gate #6 and take a shuttle bus to Gate C. So now I walk to gate #6 arriving at 0655. I waited for the shuttle bus for 10 minutes finally arriving back where I started at 0715. At this point I was clearly frustrated with the poor communication and efficiency of your employees. I asked to speak to a supervisor, again I had to wait 15 minutes. I explain my morning to her and her response was â€œOh well these things happenâ€. I worked for the MTA NYCT and if one of my employees made this statement to one of our customers who was just put thru this, I would discipline them on the spot. What a disgraceful set of circumstances. I usually fly Jet Blue, but my wife suggested trying Delta again for a change. Well after today I will never fly Delta again."

I do understand that there are â€œcomplicationsâ€ when it comes to airlines, but where is the maintenance for you aircraft? If my flight is missed, I can kiss my livelihood good bye for missing this merger meeting. There was another customer on this flight with me and he has been here since 0900 this morning because of issues with your system and extraordinary delays. I would imagine even after receiving bailout money from the government, service would still be top priority. The best that the hard working people at gate A12 could offer was hotel accommodations for the night. I wanted to buy a one way to another airline and have delta reimburse me, but no I couldnâ€™t do that. I sincerely hope you have a QA/QM team to analyze these issues and I really do hope you can address them."

We were aware of the mask rules and no food or alcohol. We learned they provided ""snack boxes"" and beer or wine in first class. We were served and removed our masks. I was offered a second glass of wine which I accepted. As I was sitting quietly, reading and finishing my beverage, the flight attendant came up from behind me to inform me I wasn't allowed to sit there without a mask. I showed her I was finishing my drink. I said essentially nothing to her. She walked away. Except for when we were served, I wore my mask and stayed in my seat except for getting up once to use the bathroom before we landed (yes, I was wearing my mask). When we landed, I was greeted by a Delta ground employee informing me that I violated their mask policy and I was now banned from Delta. That's the service you get when you don't genuflect in front of the flight attendant when she tells you something. Horrible. I have never been treated so disrespectfully. I recommend using another airline."

I speak to the other two who are TSA and ask them where I get my boarding pass and they said that lady just walked away was the only one here with Delta and you will have to rebook now. Might I add that check-in is 30 minutes early and I made the initial eye contact at 32 minutes before flight. TSA wasnâ€™t allow to go back and get her nor knock on the door. Might I add unlike large airports I was the only person in the entire airport and no flights where going out until noon so she knew I was there for her flight. I will never fly Delta again!

They have 25 flights leaving around the same time and open 3 booths to drop your luggage. They also randomly chose to let passenger to a NYC flight go before everyone else, even if our flight was at the same time. Because they are so slow, passengers missed their flights so they had to book another flight again which made the waiting time even longer. Unless you want to arrive 3 or 4 hours before your flight to be able to catch it, fly with another company."

829,7,11,July,2020,Economy Class,Tucson , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Thanks Delta, for reminding me that my pockets are not deep enough for you all to care how me or my property is treated. I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted. Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape. I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grÃ¢ce, puncture the box and it's content. So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded. This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box the agent said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to the agent , he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me. I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly Spirit. You all really showed how much you value the 9-5 regular Joe. I bet if I was a frequent first class passenger"

Due to the Virus outbreak it was not a good idea to go forward with that trip rather than refund us during a worldwide pandemic they had to make sure they kept our money ""graciously"" offering us a future credit. When it came time that we felt we could use the credit they had a policy in place saying they couldn't change the name attached to the ticket. My wife (who originally purchased the ticket) was going to use the credit instead of me. They would not allow the change even though it was the same family, trip, customer, and even credit card. It's sad when a company clearly only cares about the money and in no means the customer. You would hope that eventually no one would continue to support businesses like this that take advantage of people during hard times or any time for that matter. If you were paid then you were paid. It shouldn't make a difference who uses the ticket if the purchaser wants to transfer it. Please don't support this company's future. We can get better service by not supporting companies who don't do good business."
833,1,27,May,2020,Economy Class,Bogota , Toronto , Atlanta      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked these tickets back on May 5th. The originally flight was supposed to be June 5th, from PDX to MSP to ICT. On May 23rd, I get an email that there had been some changes to my flight and thatâ€™s when I noticed they had me leaving at 123PM and arriving at 628PM is MSP, then to ATL and finally to my destination in ICT. The thing is, my connection flight at MSP was supposed to be at 9AM that same day. Unless the airline is on to something that Iâ€™m not aware about, that connection isnâ€™t possible. I called the travel agency I booked my ticket through and the only way to fix this flight was to change the PDX to MSP flight to June 4th, same flight, same times just a day earlier with a 14 hour layover. I bit the bullet and said sure, go ahead and do that. I wake up, May 25th and Delta went ahead and changed my flight back to the original of my flight(s) all being on the same day. AGAIN, last time I checked thatâ€™s an impossible flight to make my connection. Called Delta, in attempt to fix something that I had already fixed the day prior and was put on hold for 3.5 hours to only have the call disconnected half way through. Called back and again, 3.5 hours and got â€œhung upâ€ on. Gave up and went back to communicating through the travel agency. They then informed me, the MSP to ATL flight no longer exists and there was no way for me to make my flight unless I was willing to pay the difference for another flight. I told them to cancel my booking, because I didnâ€™t want this to happen again, once I booked another flight through Delta. Ended up booking a flight through American for the one way ticket that was double the price I had paid, for the original round trip ticket! Never again will I fly with this airline. In the past Iâ€™ve never had these issues, but recently this airline has gone downhill!"

Have called Delta and they cant 'find' my booking that I made! back in January. I have the confirmation email, e-ticket, but they say that there is nothing that they can currently do as the booking doesn't exist. Would have changed the flights to the same time next year as due to the current situation we aren't going anywhere soon from the UK, and got a good deal in January on Premium seats. Frontier Airlines on the other hand refunded very quickly - not impressed with Delta's way of handling this, as they have always been a great airline in our opinion."

So I changed to a comfort seat with the middle row left empty. But the three other people in the same row had no masks. I asked the steward to get me a different seat but she said there is nothing she could do. Then the man who sat on the aisle closest to my window seat said he would wear a mask for me. Conclusion is that Delta emails you ahead of time stating they require masks. They reiterate this at the gate. They even offer masks if you don't have one. But a few people just refuse and can put an older woman with asthma, like me, at risk. If they are not asked to leave, as Delta says they will do, this will continue. In addition, Delta does not show all the selected seats on the seating selection chart, which misleads one regarding the number of people in your cabin. Imagine my shock when I was assured by the booking agent that the next two seats would be empty when only the middle seat was and the other three seats were filled with people without a mask."

I wanted to talk to the skymiles guys to see if I could upgrade to Comfort + using my points. The reservation agent said she would give me until 11 pm the next day to pay for the ticket and would switch me to the skymiles guy and I could either pay for the ticket with my credit card while talking to him and find out if I could use my points to upgrade at the same time. Transferred me, spent another hour on hold, finally got a guy and in the middle of our conversation we got cut off. Got a confirmation email from Delta, but when I tried to pay for the ticket online it could not find the reservation. Called Delta again, again on hold for well over an hour. When I did get through I was told that the ticket price was no longer what I was quoted but had increased to $811.00. I was well within the grace period for purchasing the ticket. I was not told by the first agent that the price was subject to an increase. Talked to a supervisor who said there was nothing he could do, so I paid the difference. This is bait and switch."

I spoke with a Delta customer service representative on 5 March 2020 and requested a full refund. The customer service representative consulted with a supervisor and agreed to give me a full refund without penalties as this was a COVID-19 related situation. As of 4/28/20 I have not received a refund. After spending much time in a call queue, a representative informed me that a refund would not be coming and I would only receive a voucher with time limitations, despite being told that I would receive a full refund in March. I was then transferred to another customer service representative who would only repeat the same lines over and over again. The representative refused to provide me with a transcript of my previous call, refused to transfer me to another person to provide assistance, and was incredibly rude and condescending. He would not send me anything in writing, stating a policy that he couldnâ€™t provide me with either. The representative acknowledged that I was told to expect a refund and then told me that I would never get a refund and that no one in Delta could help me. He then hung up on me after I again asked to speak with someone who could help me. Delta is refusing to honor a refund that was already promised by a Delta employee who was authorized to promise a refund. Delta's customer service is extremely offensive. It is very clear that their only role is to stonewall customers in hopes that they give up and go away. I will continue to lobby for my refund because a: it was promised to me and b: I will never willingly fly with Delta again and so a voucher is useless to me."

I wanted to take this time to highlight the good. On March 13th I was in Miami and the corona-virus was becoming a huge issue and my mom thought it would be a good idea that I flew home and I too thought it would be a good idea so I proceeded to book my flight to leave the following morning. When I booked the flight I thought I put insurance on the ticket turns out I did not. The next morning came and unfortunately I missed my flight I was a bit upset but not surprised because I honestly was not prepared. Knowing that I had not put insurance on the ticket I was upset that I would now be out of $130. With everything going on, money no matter the amount, is very much needed for rainy days but I knew that my own irresponsibility had put me in this position so I just let the situation go. So fast forward to today, March 31st, I had got paid and when I went to go check my account there was an extra $130 in my account. Of course at this point I had forgotten all about the ticket and I had already knew I didn't buy the ticket insurance so I was not at all expecting any type of refund. So I went in my payment history to see where the money had come from and sure enough it said ""Delta Airlines"". That's the difference between a good company and a GREAT company. I just wanted to say I truly appreciate the Delta community because they did not at all have to do that, but they did! And as I stated before people tend to shed light on all of the bad things before they sit and appreciate the good and that honestly made my day! Thank you guys for all that you do."

During the Coronavirus pandemic, Delta should be lucky anybody is flying their airline. I was perturbed when told that although we were on an 80% empty plane, they were still following rules of one carry one and one personal item. The overhead bins are empty. I want to bring an extra suitcase without checking it for more grubby hands to be touching my stuff. But no, Delta badly wants to touch your bags and collect an extra fee. Southwest didn't give me grief for this issue so I'm only flying Southwest. Plane is more comfortable than Southwest's crammed seats but in this pandemic I don't like their baggage policies.

I have been a loyal Delta and Sky team Medallion customer for over 7 years. However, in the 17 months, every time I fly Delta, there are issues that end up costing me significantly more money that I anticipated. This is true of business, first and economy tickets I have flown in over 23 different flights. Customer service is useless and seem to always give wrong and incorrect information. Issues have ranged from damage to expensive suitcases, no food with first class tickets on the plane, rude airline staff, rude and stupid supervisors in customer service that cannot do simple math. You name it. So, I have decided never ever to fly Delta or any Sky team airlines again. This applies also to all my staff. I would rather fly a cheap low budget airline and at least get what I pay for than fly Delta. They are a complete joke. And I recommend everyone else that plans on flying heeds to this advice or enjoy the disasters to come. Delta used to be a good airline, but now they suck."

Our flight was initially scheduled for Tuesday Mar 17th, however the weekend leading up, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada began urging Canadian citizens and residents to return home. With customer service phone-lines bogged up because of the crisis, we decided to take our chances and head to the airport a day early to see if there was any chance we could return sooner. Luckily, we were met with Dionne at the Delta Check-In (Terminal 2, at LaGuardia airport). Dionne had to deal with a faulty system that forced her to enter our passport credentials manually, but she handled it with grace and humour (which was really needed at that moment). She also did everything she could to find all the options available to us. Thankfully, she was able to get us on a flight later that day, direct to Toronto. Regardless of that, she acted as a professional, very calm and direct, and most importantly as a compassionate human to two Canadians hopped up on little sleep and lots of anxiety and uncertainty. Needed in these times. So above all else, thank you Dionne for how you stepped up, and likely stepped up before, and will continue to have to step up for your customers and staff. We appreciate you, and we hope this finds its way to you!"

Fully retrofitted 767 felt brand new even though it was 20 years old! Far superior to Unitedâ€™s 767-400 product I flew last year! Not only was the plane refurbished but the service had been recently enhanced! Flight was only half full which obviously helped! Delta start the service with a peach Bellini which was really nice! They also offered headphones and an eye mask as well as proper sized bottle of water. A menu leaflet was also offered. Dinner was a choice of 2 starters and 3 mains. I had harissa shrimp and the ravioli which again were both really tasty. Followed with a gin and tonic and some ice cream. Seat was comfortable enough for the 6hr flight, good cushioning and great headrest although the pitch was a little tight but adequate. A decent quality blanket and pillow were also distributed. Fantastic IFE system and free basic WiFi to message on! Crew were very relaxed and informal and came round with regular water and juice runs. A small cinnamon danish and drinks were served prior to landing. For a short economy transatlantic crossing Deltaâ€™s retrofitted 767-400 would be my choice!"

On this journey, the plane had quite a few unoccupied seats - I had the entire row to myself! What a pleasant difference it makes not to feel packed in! Flight attendants were efficient, beverage and snacks were served, pilots kept us informed, the aircraft was tidy, and the plane departed and arrived on time! What more could one ask for? The connecting flight from Minneapolis to Fargo was on a smaller plane and there was no inflight service. Again, there were empty seats which made boarding and disembarking quick and no hassles with stashing the oversized winter jackets we have on at this time of the year in that part of the country.

What is not forgivable is the lies I was told by numerous Delta representatives nearly every day. I was told that my luggage had been recovered the day after it went missing. The automated message assured me that my property would be on its way to me later that day or the day after. This went on every day of my Christmas holiday until the bag arrived the day after I left. I spent hours on the phone waiting for answers and was told that I would not be charged for the bill. I eventually received a massive bill that Delta refused to reimburse me for. They awarded me credit vouchers to the value of half of my phone bill. My bag was missing for one month despite me knowing its exact location every day of its misplacement. I asked Delta many times to let me take care of recovering it but they refused and promised to take care of as soon as possible. Whether pure incompetence, dishonesty or carelessness, I cannot forgive Delta for ruining my Christmas holidays. Offering me a credit voucher for my inconvenience and no refund for the phone bill that I was told I wouldn't have to pay is shameful in my opinion.

When it comes to choosing an airline, I am sure many would agree with me that the biggest factor in this decision is trust. Trusting the airline to get you to your destination safely. Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure. When I called Deltaâ€™s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers. When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team.  It is safe to say that I will never be flying Delta again and I hope that my story will show others that Delta cannot be trusted."

Overall a great experience with Delta Air Lines on their A220-100 aircraft. We were actually allowed 1 free checked bag per person allowing us to put all of our baggage into the hold and simply ignore the overhead bins. We actually departed five minutes ahead of schedule as the boarding process went very smoothly. This was the first time I ever had a flight depart ahead of schedule and I have to say it worked out very well. The seating was amazing and the seats all had massive padded headrests which were also adjustable, something very rare on such a small narrowbody aircraft. The food was also amazing and Delta have a wide variety of complimentary snacks and beverages, but I also got their protein box -s easily worth the $9 I paid for it. The only thing holding this back from a 10/10 was that the in-flight entertainment system on my plane wasn't working, but an issue like this is quite rare. We just got unlucky, but I didn't mind it all that much as I slept for most of the flight. Overall, this flight was well worth waking up at 2:30 A.M, as this was easily the best domestic flight I have ever flown on (even with the nonfunctional IFE.)"

My experience flying from Atlanta to Baltimore on a Delta flight was horrible! I paid extra for the comfort plus and all I got was one cup of lukewarm water! It wasn't even cold water! I realize I wasn't sitting in 1st class, a but it was really difficult to sit there drinking my lukewarm water while the flight attendant in 1st class was busily serving them constantly! I also realize it was a rough flight, but they could have done something for us other than this terrible water! At the end of the trip, they had the nerve to ask us to take our own trash out. I left my one little plastic cup. I left it behind with the trash that was left by the previous passenger that was in my seat. They didn't even bother to clean up after their passengers before they boarded us! Clearly that person was not served only one little cup of lukewarm water. They were obviously served the snacks and wine, which is what I thought I was going to get as a passenger in Comfort Plus. I, on the other hand, never even saw our flight attendant again after she handed me that cup of lukewarm water. I will never fly Delta again!"

We arrived at the airport about an hour before our flight and the first representative sent us to another, full-service counter. By the time we were assisted at the ""correct"" ticket counter, the flight was scheduled to depart in 40 minutes. Instead of Delta making an exception for the 5 minutes we were late to check in our bags (apparently you have to arrive no later than 45 minutes before the departure time), they told me there was nothing they could do and that if I wanted to transfer my ticket, it was going to cost $618 per person (x3), or I could just buy three new tickets for the next flight (4 hours later) for $488 per person,  which included my significant other and my 4 year old.  Delta made ZERO attempt to assist my family in getting home, getting our bags to the plane, or even the next flight would have been fine, and gave us a choice: You either cough up at least $1,500 or we are out of luck. We had to spend $600 in renting a car, staying at a hotel, gas and purchasing meals to drive from Atlanta to Miami for 10+ hours of driving time. This was a power play on behalf of Delta and I will take this into consideration when booking my next flight. ALL Delta cares about is money."

First of all this flight was delayed by and hour and the gate switched 3 different times. Because of this I was really cutting it close on time. They asked us to check all remaining bags. This didnâ€™t work for me because I didnâ€™t have 25 minutes to spare after landing. I kindly asked if I could just check if there was room in the overhead bins. At the gate they said sure no problem. As I entered the plane a stewardess confronted me rudely and told me I had to check the bag. Again I kindly asked if I could just check if there was room as I was the last passenger on the plane and the delay would make me late already. She angrily told me there is no room with her hand on my bag. I said ok, sure, and she took my bag back out. Iâ€™m not exaggerating, on the way to my seat (22F) I literally passed 12-15 bag spaces in the plane. Really dumb that they made me check my bag."

I took Delta flights multiple times between Europe and Seattle in the past 2 years and am still wondering how this airline has got only 3 stars. Based on my experience DL has the best long haul economy service that no other carrier I have ever used could beat (LH, OS, EK, KL, QR, HU). The reasons are the next: 1) A330s and 767s: 2-whatever-2 layout is much more traveller friendly than 3-whatever-3 (worst experience is KLâ€™s 787). 2) stable wifi: Gogo did a great job. This time there was some short connectivity issue over the Canadian permafrost 3) clean cabin: I donâ€™t know why this is a big challenge for others, but if you collect garbage frequently, then the cabin will stay clean 4) surprisingly good food and beverages: first time in my life I liked airline meal. SweetWater ale is also a big plus. Delta might do a decent job only on the Seattle routs but they do a really great job there. Hopefully, European and other North American airlines will recognize the difference and will follow Deltaâ€™s quality."
876,1,11,February,2020,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Sydney       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I had a flight from Cancun to Pittsburgh connecting through Atlanta yesterday. On my first flight, a cup of coffee was spilled on my lap after the passenger sitting next to me was bumped by the flight attendant and spilled her coffee. I accept accidents happen and I managed as best I could despite being wet and sticky. I shrugged this off and hurried to immigration/ customs. I have global entry and only had carry-on luggage and saw that there was a 2 hour earlier flight on Delta (15699) that would allow me to get home sooner, out of my sticky clothes and permit me to surprise my 8 year old son by getting to his swim competition in time. From online, it appeared there were over 20 seats open in the main cabin. I stopped at the delta baggage desk right after Customs and asked if this was possible and they said yes but that I had to run up to the gate since it was already boarding. I did just that- I ran! I got myself from the F concourse to the B concourse, Gate 5 and the area was clear, the gate was open for another 5 minutes and was staffed by an agent. I had to rest for 30 seconds just to catch my breath. I explained the agent what the Delta agents had told me to do. His response- was flat and dismissive ""Are you a Delta Platinum member?"" ""Are you A Delta Gold Member?"" I said no to both queries. His next response ""Well then you will have to pay $75 for a ticket change."" I explained that the representatives had indicated this would not be a problem as there were so many seats open- I was already travelling on Delta and normally this flight would not be available to me book as the time between flights is too small to be permitted to book during the initial reservation. I explained how my clothes were now sticky as a result of the coffee being spilled on me. I explained about my 8 year old and wanting to get home. None of this mattered. I was nobody to the agent. My impression after this - Delta only cares about you if you are a Platinum or Gold member. (Ironically I had considered, an hour earlier while in flight, applying for the platinum card as my husband sits on the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and flies often for board meetings. Suffice to say- I will stick with my existing airline credit cards and skip Delta's card as I do not see myself electively travelling on Delta in the future). I begged the agent to call a supervisor - he did but he dawdled and the gate was just 2 minutes from closing. I watched painfully as the door closed and the plane took off and the agent didn't care. There was no empathy, no compassion. Nothing.  I couldn't believe that this Delta agent would let me stand there, bag in hand, knowing he could have been kind and allowed me to see my family earlier, see my son compete and offset my unfortunate 'coffee in the lap' experience. I couldn't believe that he let me sit there knowing how many seats were empty on that flight just to make a point -pay the $75 or wait without reason. The irony is that my scheduled delta flight, 2 hours later, was so full that they had customers waiting in standby. That agent could have freed up my seat if he had let me get on the earlier flight. Poor service all the way around. I will avoid Delta whenever possible."
877,9,9,February,2020,Economy Class,Paris , New York       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Verified ," Minneapolis to Salt Lake City. I have been flying with Delta for my whole life. 40+ years of flights and all over the world. But I'm starting to notice that their service is becoming as second rate as other airlines. I was recently flying home on Christmas Eve and was so early to the gate that me and my colleague decided to grab a quick bite very close by. As we sat there and eventually watched other passengers board, we finished our meal and headed back over to the gate. When we got there they informed us they had given our seats away. No intercom, no warning, nothing -- just oversold and a whole bunch of people trying to get to their families in time for Christmas. So they bumped us. The next two flights were also oversold and so we had to buy two new tickets to get home late that night. It took us 9 extra hours to get home and had to fly through Seattle instead of on the direct flight we had seats for. We got to SLC late and many passengers were trying to get to connecting flights. One woman, in particular, had a young sleepy girl and was carrying large bags. She had only a few minutes to get to her gate and was going to miss her flight. We picked up her bags and sprinted no less than a half mile to the other terminal and caught them as they were closing the doors. We told her a woman was coming with her baby and to please hold the flight. It was an honor to get this poor woman and her child on her flight and we saved Delta from her missing her plane on Christmas Eve. That would have been 100% their fault. Now - I just spent 2 hours on the phone hoping Delta would show us a courtsey of some kind of credit for having to spend an extra $750 on new tickets to get home. Their customer service talked over me, did not employ good English, was disrespectful and told me it was all my fault. Even if that's true - why would you not do all you can to save a customer or to take care of a customer who has been so loyal? Why be just like so many other airlines? Delta has become too big and is losing what made them special. I can't believe I'm saying this - but I will choose them last from here on out. So truly disappointing."

Pleasantly surprised by this overall experience after hearing so many bad reviews. Ground experience at LHR T3 was ok, check in was pretty smooth, and security typically ok but not amazing. Boarding relatively efficient and uneventful. The seat was ok - not too cramped by comparison to other carriers. IFE was good and had a good amount of content, and a good size screen. The main meal service was surprisingly good and tasted really fresh for an economy service. the quantity of food was also good. The pizza snack before landing was ok but not as good as the main meal service.The crew were good, curteous and professional, although overall I think they could have checked on us a bit more often. They seemed to get the main meal service done and then disappeared for hours without appearing at all. Overall a good experience which I would recommend."

I recently purchased a first-class return ticket from Orlando (MCO) to Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA). Before my return flight, I suffered hours of delays until they finally cancelled the flight late that night. They offered no vouchers for food or hotel. Although I had paid for first class, the next day I flew home in a back seat by the families and bathrooms. This treatment is par for the course for Delta. Iâ€™m used to it. But what frosted my cake was, just this weekend, I signed into Delta to choose my Diamond benefit certificates. They were all closed out. Turns out I was one day late! I wrote Delta, explaining that I had missed their guideline by a day, that it was my fault, and could they help me? I quickly received this curt one-line reply: â€œUnfortunately, once these expire or are used, these certificates cannot be reopened.â€ If this is how they treat their very best customers, how do you think theyâ€™ll treat you? I suggest you fly another airline. I know I will."

I talked to a Delta rep at another gate and asked him to send me out on an earlier flight. Told me I had to buy a new ticket. Finally found the delta services desk, they gave me a new ticket for the next flight to Boston. Here, I was told they had no time to collect my luggage. Fine, sending to PVD. All these while making calls and rearranging my transportation. All of these took me 1 hour and 40 minutes. Running from one end to another at this Atlanta airport. My luggage did make it on my flight to BOS and they had to send it to PVD. Here I seat waiting at T F Green for a Delta rep to come and give me my luggage as there is no one around.

Seat was clean and spacious with good entertainment. Good choice of food, appetizer was amazing and fresh. I expected a little bit more choice of vines but it was still ok. And the best thing is of course the wifi. I did not expect that very fast on the messenger and instagram. The only minus about this trip was Delta business class lounge. I don't recommend it, the food is cold almost everything is for pay and plates are from paper. In my opinion those cannot be served in business class lounge in such a large airline like delta."

Most of us were told weâ€™d have to stay in Japan for a day or two. None of the Delta employees knew what to do, they just kept pushing us out of the airport. Immigration was puzzled too. They gave us two meal vouchers for a restaurant in the hotel. The times were very restrictive. After I checked in I took a nap and when I woke up my voucher had expired. Delta sucks.

I called customer care and they added another 1000 points (I can now enjoy some cookies with my coffee). No longer are they my airline of choice. I would have at a minimum expected two $400 vouchers.

I used my frequent flier miles to take this trip and was able to secure aisle seats at the time of booking. Both outbound and inbound flights had all seats occupied and overhead cabins, though generous in size, were stuffed with bags and winter clothes. Snack service provided once. Flights were more or less on schedule. The lavatories in the 737-900 were unbelievably compact - no space to even take a picture to show that. They were at the very rear of the aircraft. On the 757 too the lavatories are at the very back. It is a long walk and woe for the passengers in those back rows having to bear people congregating to use the bathrooms. Seats equipped with TV monitor with a good selection of films available plus the air show where one can track the flight. Leg space just adequate. Flight attendants friendly. Boarding, though orderly, looked and felt chaotic as we all waited anxiously for our group to be called as we saw others board with big bags. I guess we were fearing we would not find space for our own bags when we got in. The boarding gate staff repeatedly solicited that we check the bags for free. Some did. I did not! I got lucky and found space to stash my backpack, ski jacket, and a small roller suitcase. All in all, it was a frantic experience at both ends to board the plane!"

Very annoyed to pay for a comfy seat to be put at the back of the plane and me in the very last row. Had no idea this happened until all of our original cabin was filled and our tickets had been re issued. The worst thing was we were at the gate before anybody else and I asked the flight staff to organise this with plenty of time. I do hope there is a refunding process for this muck around. I will never fly Delta again as even on our flight to the USA the on board crew where very unprofessional and rude. 2 flights with Delta long haul, both very disappointing. Very tiring.

I got to my row and I couldnâ€™t sit in my seat because the flight attendant was in the space, leaning over to the row behind to chat with the passenger seated there. The seats are narrow. Maybe I am too used to Asian, European and Middle Eastern carries where the airplane is always clean (as you embark) whether youâ€™re in business or economy class and the staff is courteous and greet you with smiles. I also fly budget airlines like for short trips and those airplanes are clean and both ground and air crew are nice too.

About 6 days before the flight, my app showed no seats available in first, even for dollars or miles.

I asked to be put on this earlier flight due to a high winds advisory in my home airport and my son's disability, which makes long waits in a busy place challenging. I provided documentation from weather.com of this advisory. Delta loses nothing by putting me on this earlier flight and only to gain my customer satisfaction. However, their customer service agents refused offering no explanation. Teresa at Montego Bay was my last conversation and she was not polite or helpful. I have routinely made similar switches to an earlier flight on Delta and other airlines even when no wind advisory existed. I will think twice about using Delta again due to this poor service."

We were a party of 6 flying to New York for our Winter Break. We had 3 minors traveling with us, the youngest was 11 and was nervous about flying. We did not pay the extra fee to choose our seats because we has flown other times on other airlines and never had to pay to be seated together. We really do not have a preference where on the plane we sit as long as we are seated together. This has been the first time ever that all of us were seated in completely different rows throughout the plane. All of us got middle seats between 2 strangers. I was very upset that my kids had to fly alone and sit between 2 strangers. I asked the flight attendant to please help me find someone to switch seats so that at least my youngest son would not have to be alone. She offered to come see me once we were on the plane and try to help me but no one ever came to me. I asked the person next to me who was an adult flying alone if she would switch with my son and she refused to. It is very upsetting to know that this airline only cares about making extra money on allowing people to pay for choosing their seats even if it means splitting up children from their families.  I kept thinking what if those adults are watching or saying something inappropriate next to my child, or something even worse. Also, if it had been a flight with turbulence, he would've been very nervous alone. Flying can be scary even for many adults. After this experience, I will definitely never fly Delta again which is a shame because they do have comfortable seats and offer snacks and drinks which many other airlines do not. They also have movies to choose from which help the flights go by faster. I have flown with my family many times and have never had this happen. It really should not be allowed. I will not recommend this airline to anyone traveling with their family."

We were not allowed to upgrade on our way home. We could only use the voucher on a new flight. That is cheeky in my opinion. It should be at our discretion. When we were in conversation with Delta representatives, they were less than kind and very unprofessional.

Just a clear shift of blame and lack of integrity to own up to their company's mistakes. Will never fly with such a shady airline again. Poorly played, Delta."
900,1,3,January,2020,Economy Class,San Francisco , Belo Horizonte , Atlanta    ,Business,South Korea, Trip Verified ,"  Atlanta to Seoul. Going to the US, I flew Deltaâ€™s Premium Select in which I was told is very roomy. It is not. There is more room on Korean Air economy. So for the return, I upgraded to Delta One. Little did I know this was the worst flight I would have ever taken.  First, my seat would not recline even though the seats a re supposed to lay flat., my TV stopped working an hour into the flight. I had no entertainment, nor did I have any concept of time since I couldnâ€™t see where I was in flight. In Delta One, you can only turn on the light or call the flight attendant through the monitor. Well, since mine didnâ€™t work I had to get up each time to find an attendant because they were never around. When I first told the flight attendant that my television did not work, her response to me was, â€œI am not a mechanicâ€. The meals were cold. I had to use my flashlight on my phone to see.  The door to my seat got stuck where I had to jam it open. And the charger worked intermittently throughout the flight. And I was told it was a brand new plane.  I had no rest and was tired and sleepy when I arrived in Seoul, yet I still had to conduct my meetings. My flight was worse than an economy ticket. One if the flight attendants offered me miles and I told them I want the money back because it was not a business class experience at all. I had originally paid $703 to upgrade to Premium select until my first flight so I upgraded to Delta One for $1,532. After my flight I requested to be refunded for my upgrade. I was told they would refund my ticket upgrade and would give me $724. I told them that was not my upgrade amount. Then they wrote me back and said that was half of the amount for the upgrade. I would never fly nor recommend this airline. It is just like all the other American airlines - poor customer service, filled with arrogant employees. This was my first time with Delta and my last."

I had a very good experience with your representative Javon, I had accidentally booked a double flight home (one which was first class) and he refunded my economy class ticket which was accidentally booked. The representative was very respectful and accommodating to me. He took the time to listen, which is important. Because of him I will be flying delta many times. Thank you so much."
902,1,31,December,2019,Economy Class,Paris , Raleigh Durham       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," We have flown Delta 3 times with nothing but problems. Our first venture consisted of delays and lost luggage. Recently we were en route to a very important family event that we ended up missing. The ticket counter said â€œthe pilots arenâ€™t here yetâ€ 30 minutes after we were supposed to board. Then there was a problem with the plane that needed repair, Iâ€™m all for that. However, we took off almost 1.5 hours after the initial time and missed our connection. Had to stay in Seattle as the next flight wasnâ€™t until the next day, Delta covered that. On the way back they over booked the flight and said we couldnâ€™t board until 4 volunteers accepted $1000 to stay. I called and talked with Delta about this and the response was 2 $100 gift cards. (She did mention she was told to offer only $25 but did more because she felt bad) I talked to a staff member who was very apologetic and comforting. But I feel like that just isnâ€™t good enough. They refused anything more because they paid for our dumpy hotel when we were stranded in Seattle. Iâ€™ll definitely be flying Alaska Airlines from now on, they have not one time let us down. This was the last straw for Delta."

Leg room and seat comfort are the two most important elements to me when flying. Compared to other airlines I've flown with such as Air Canada and Alaska, Delta delivered on these better, although there is still much room for improvement.

Worst airline ever told us we had to gate check our rolling carry-on because â€œthe overhead bins are fullâ€. Usually I would volunteer for that but previous flight it took over one hour to get our bags so we didnâ€™t. When we got to our seat the overhead bin above us was empty. It remained empty except for my backpack and wifeâ€™s purse. Then at the carousel my wifeâ€™s bag did not come. Went to lost bags the bag had been opened. Furthermore my mom and daughter were on another flight boarded they were immediately asked to deboard. Said there was issue with the wing. The plane was there all night they couldnâ€™t find the problem then? 
905,5,30,December,2019,Economy Class,Las Vegas , Seattle       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified , Philadelphia to Kansas City. I understand delays and such however I do not understand scheduling my flight to land at one time and my connecting flight to leave 20 minutes later. Without delay that still leaves virtually no window to get to your next flight. All of this I can somewhat swallow. My biggest issue are the employees that work the airports. The staff on the planes are great however the other while â€œprofessionalâ€ are very unhelpful nor do they help. They clearly show they don't care about us and hide behind fake smiles. I will never fly Delta Air Lines again for this simple fact. Perhaps you can remind your employees that this is still customer service.
906,2,28,December,2019,Economy Class,Toronto , Ft Lauderdale       , Detroit     ,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Las Vegas to San Diego. Everything about my experience was very average with Delta. Nothing was exceptional or horrible. However, they called pre-boarding for passengers with medical equipment or additional time requirements. I utilize a CPAP because I am diagnosed with severe sleep apnea (nevermind the fact that I am also a service member and most airlines recognize this and offer early boarding for that reason alone). The ticket agent was very curt and made a huge deal about me only having a CPAP. Who is she to discriminate my medical condition and reduce it as something not important? I felt embarrassed, but she eventually allowed me to pass when I refused to be put down by her horrible behavior. I will never use Delta again and will discourage others from doing so as well."
907,8,26,December,2019,Economy Class,Charlotte , Seoul , Atlanta      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Atlanta to Vail. We are a family of five and travel every 25th of Christmas. We paid a premium price for the convenience of flying a non stop flight from Atlanta into Eagles Vail airport in Colorado, as recommended we confirmed the flight and it was listed to be ON TIME departing in Atlanta at 10:12 am. 2 hours before the schedule departure time it was delayed by 3 hours, to be departing at 1:15 pm after getting the initial disappointment of this three hours delay and waiting for an hour and a half, we were informed that the flight was now delayed until 6:30pm the reason for the delay in both cases was the Unavailability of finding a captain to fly the plane. When approaching the attendant at the service counter, the answer was that they have no further information that they could not guarantee the departure time of 6:30 and to take a complementary cookie and be comfortable. Everyone scheduled to be in this flight was treated with disgusting corporate arrogance. As a family traveling with three kids and paying full price for plane ticket. I think we deserved a little bit better than a complementary snacks. In any other type of business companyâ€™s are more held to account but airlines get away with their paying customers like crap."
908,2,25,December,2019,Economy Class,Boston , Austin , New York     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Minneapolis to Newark. The crew were sociable and warm and greeted me with genuine kindness. One of the noticeable staff members was Nealy. She spoke to my sister and I for a brief period of time, and she was professional, sincere, and ecstatic about working with others.  She made my whole trip. Good job Delta!"

910,4,19,December,2019,Economy Class,Charlotte , Phoenix , Salt Lake City    ,Couple Leisure,Canada, Trip Verified ,"  Saskatoon to Miami via Minneapolis. Like any airline, Iâ€™ve had a hit-or-miss experience with Delta. All in all though, Iâ€™ve been impressed with them in recent years. Staff is usually pretty good, seats, entertainment and flight attendants are often exceptional, etc. One complaint, is the economy basic seat assignment algorithms donâ€™t seem to put travelers together initially (hard to verify this, but on a return trip my wife and I were separated on 3 of the 4 legs). Most times it seems like the gate does manage to rearrange seats, but itâ€™s an unnecessary stress/step. It feels like they separate basic economy passengers so (a) they pay to get seats together, or (b) Delta looks good by getting them back together. I guess after traveling for a few decades, I came to expect sitting next to my wife as a basic requirement of service, so the entire extent of any negativity in this review should be attributed to my discontent over the shift away from that strategy. Otherwise, I am fairly impressed with Delta flights."
911,10,18,December,2019,Economy Class,West Palm Beach , Montreal        , La Guardia    ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Seattle to Boston. Delta is one of the few North American carriers clinging to some sense of ethical transportation. The seats are not comfortable but functional, the planes can be inconsistent with awkward or ok leg space, the service is decent and often comforting, there are still video screens on the seats (although some are so tiny it's almost a joke), and they are serving some food again which is a nice touch. It still has some serious problems with the overhead bins being tiny; the pilot and flight attendants entreated us 5 or so separate times to NOT put your small backpack and jacket in the bins, but to place them on the ground to make space for roller bags. I should not be punished for packing light and only having a small backpack, and I refuse to put the blazer i will be wearing the following day in an interview on the ground. The bathrooms were a total disaster throughout the flight, with urine covering the floor, tissues everywhere, and garbage overflowing. Delta can improve dramatically, but unfortunately this is close to the best available from USA carriers at the moment"
912,1,17,December,2019,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth , Salt Lake City    ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Nashville to New York. Flight got delayed and I missed my connecting flight to Brussels. Have to wait for another day and they could not even help me with a hotel. Was very stranded. To rebooked I had to stay on the phone for almost 2hours because they didn't want to give me earlier alternatives. My worst experience ever.
913,8,16,December,2019,Economy Class,Dallas , Washington , Atlanta      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I had many transportation issues and missed my departing flight, and made my own arrangements to travel to my destination. However, instead of trying to provide some assistance, Delta actually cancelled my returning flight without any notice. Over the phone, they said there was nothing they could do, and since I missed my departing flight, they automatically cancel the returning flight without any refund.  This is very disappointing from a established airline company to which I have been loyal for many years."
914,1,15,December,2019,Economy Class,Houston , Rochester , Detroit      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , I had a roller bag with me and was flying a 2 stop 19 hour flight. They took my roller bag for checking in and forced me to put the weight of both bags into my backpack. When I came out of the plane everyone was extremely rude and refused to help me get my roller bag back. I was forced to carry 20 pounds on my back for 19 hours. What they did to me was inhumane.
915,1,14,December,2019,Premium Economy,Madison , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Missed my early flight due to confusion and went to talk to the ticket agent while really stressed out. All it took was ten minutes and one phone call and they got me on a different flight, same day, arriving an hour early at no charge. Easily the most hassle-free airport experience Iâ€™ve ever had and I am grateful for the ticket agents at Des Moines for Delta who were so helpful. Delta is by far my favorite airline to travel with. Thank you so much for turning a very stressful situation around so quickly."
916,1,12,December,2019,Economy Class,Seattle , Calgary        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Our return trip home on Delta was much nicer than our outbound trip on Air France. Sat in Comfort+ and the seats were reasonably comfortable with plenty of leg room. We were delayed getting off the ground due to an Air Traffic Control slow down (during the nationwide strikes on December 6th) but the flight crew kept us informed. We had to take a bus to a remote stand so boarding was somewhat slow and disjointed. That was not announced in advance but became obvious when there was no Delta aircraft at the gate. Once on board, the service was excellent. This was our third international trip on Delta this year and the cabin crews are significantly better than most airlines I have flown recently (with the possible exception of some of the Asian airlines). After take off the crew gave out water bottles and amenity kits then followed that with a welcome on board drink. Then meal service with three options (outlined on the printed menu and flight schedule which had been handed out at the start of the flight). During the flight the flight attendants came through four times offering water or juice and I also saw the flight attendants bring drinks to those who requested them. Snacks were available any time at the back of the plane. A pre-arrival snack with more beverages was offered about an hour before the end of the flight. Just before arrival, the flight attendants came around with farewell candies (in this case mini Toblerone bars) and thanked everyone for flying Delta. Outside of a some minor distractions - the awkward bus transport and restrooms showing their age - the flight was very good. The Delta crew did a great job (which was also consistent with our recent experiences on Delta international flights)."
917,1,11,December,2019,Economy Class,Los Angeles , Orlando       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. Me and my husband sat in traffic for 2 hours to get to JFK airport before our flight. We finally get to the airport 45 mins before our flight leaves and we are immediately told to go to rebookings. Iâ€™ve never in my life have had an airline not try to help someone make a flight. The person helping us at rebookings acted like she could care less. Not only did we miss that flight we had to rebook for the tomorrow and pay 600 in fees to change the flight. Plus we had to pay another 100 for a place to stay tonight. This has truly been a nightmare and I will never fly with Delta again!

My son is in the military and stationed in Kentucky, bought a round trip ticket from Nashville to Portland on the 7th and from Portland to Nashville on 28th. He had a layover on his way home in Seattle so I told him not to go to Portland that I would pick him up in Seattle as it was just as close to me as Portland. Well because he did not get on the flight to Portland and they canceled his return flight back to Nashville at the end of the month and would not refund so he had to pay for his flight back to base twice! What a horrible thing to do to people!"

Delta will rearrange their seats last minute to accommodate family needs regardless of other people's circumstances. They will pay the same price ticket but boot you out of your seat to put someone else's needs before you. Families who were unable to book without enough courtesy of others should find another flight. No one should have to feel that their needs outweigh another's. I paid the same price as others. I should be given the courtesy to sit on the seat I was offered and reserved. I was further displeased to learn that others on the same flight had been displaced.

The lady at Delta baggage claim at Detroit was super helpful, I left my momâ€™s medication in my luggage (carry on got checked at boarding, thought I would be able to pick it up when I get off the plane).

The food is above average when compared to other international flights. That makes long journey more comfortable as the food is good. Though on the other hand, the plate is a bit too small. Flight is on time and good, even the CLT-ATL flight arrives 15 minutes before ETA, an early arrival is always good. Inflight entertainment and Wi-Fi is good, inflight entertainment is complete and all of the movies are pretty up to date. Very good selection of movies and entertainment onboard. They also have wifi, notably on the domestic leg, and the Wi-Fi is quite slow, though it is acceptable considering the situation. Seat is comfortable, though the leg room in the Main Cabin is a little too cramped."
922,1,5,December,2019,First Class,Detroit , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I don't fly economy often, but to due the holiday, First Class was full. Flew from Boston to Austin via New York in the midst of a massive snow storm. BOS to JFK was delay by 30 minutes, due to ground operations, understandable and not initially an issue as I had a couple hours in JFK before flying onto AUS. We were upgraded to comfort plus due to my status, which provided a little extra leg room, which turned out to be a god send, as the weather caused us to need to de ice, then be number 28th in line for take off due to Logan Airport only having 1 runway in operation, again due to the storm. In short, gate to gate was just over 3 hours, the crew did provide snacks and drinks en route, due to the long delays, which was nice. Had 25 minutes to catch my connection to AUS, thankfully gate was right next door. This time in economy, We had 3 seats together. Take off was about 15 minutes delayed as Delta was attempting to play catch up due to the bad weather further north. Legroom was decent and we purchased a lunch from Delta's flight fuel menu. A really nice sandwich, chips and cookie, with condiments, a napkin and plastic utensil for $11.00. The quality was much better than I expected and I enjoyed my very first Buy on Board experience. Multiple drink rounds and snack offerings en route. Good in flight entertainment, landed on time and my bags were waiting for me at baggage. A really solid level of service."
923,3,5,December,2019,Economy Class,Atlanta , Frankfurt        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Flew in first 2 days prior to Thanksgiving from AUS to BOS, my 6am Nonstop to Boston had a mechanical issue and flight was delayed 11.5 hours! With a pre holiday crowded flight, as you can imagine, the gate area erupted into chaos. I retreated to the Austin Sky Lounge, which is fantastic to search for other options. The delta App is fine, however, I found more options available via the website. Rerouted to fly AUS to JFK to BOS, First Class to JFK then economy to Bos. My new routing required me to spend 6 hours in the AUS Sky Club, then fly out later that afternoon. AUS SkyClub is the best. Great ambiance, had a hearty Breakfast and lunch, with great food options. Flew First Class to JFK on an A320, plenty comfortable, nice pre departure beverage, once in the air, my 2nd lunch for the day. Delta offer a burger for the hot option. At first I was a little disappointed, but I must say the burger was fresh, hot and tasted great. A nice potato salad, vs a a bag of chips and a another great chocolate dessert. On time into JFK has a couple of hours, thank goodness as I had to change terminals. The Delta inter terminal Jitney Service is pretty quick. The JFK SkyClub, terminal 4 is under renovation, so pretty disappointing and way to crowded, as it was 7pm. A quick 35 minute flight to BOS in economy this time as First Class was booked when I had to change my flights. Exit row was nice, no service due to the short duration, Landed 10 hours past my original arrival time, but hey, things happen. Delta provided 3 of us, 20,000 miles each and a $200 credit voucher for the delay and downgrade on the last flight from JFK to BOS, which I felt was more than fair. I used twitter messenger to contact Delta Customer Service,. They were responsive, empathetic and in short great to deal with. Long Day, but they got me to my destination. This was one day that my Sky Club membership proved invaluable."
924,1,4,December,2019,Economy Class,Portland , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified , Charlotte to Phoenix via Salt Lake City. Missed connection to Phoenix. If I didn't know better I would believe the flight from Charlotte to Salt Lake left an hour late on purpose. Maybe they were overbooked in Salt Lake but the pilot seemed to be killing time with a lame excuse about some minor issue that didn't really need fixing so we sat there an hour. Then he came back and said he was checking the wings for ice. There was no ice on the wings. Temp was in the 40s but we de iced anyway to kill more time then he taxied aimlessly around the tarmac before 20 more minutes before finally leaving just late enough to miss the connection to Phoenix. I ended up having to hang around for 3 hours to catch the next flight out by only 30 minutes. Will never fly Delta again.

So they end up booked me another flight YUL to Detroit. I end up spend 7 hours at Detroit airport for them take me to MontrÃ©al. I arrived to MontrÃ©al at 11pm something when I suppose to get there at 1:19pm. The worst is the staff just look at me like it was nothing."
926,8,3,December,2019,Economy Class,San Francisco , Fairbanks       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Salt Lake City. I love Delta. I have had delayed flights with this airline but that happens and I expect as much sometimes. However, when I spend more money for a comfort+ ticket so my boyfriend and I can travel home more comfortably after the holiday, I also expect as much. I did not read anywhere that our seats may not have entertainment screens in front of them. I feel as though Delta made no effort in informing me as a customer about this possibility and my overall very positive image of Delta has now been tainted. I do not recommend comfort+ unless you're willing to risk losing hours of entertainment (flight distractions) for more leg room. Incredibly disappointed in what was my favorite airline."

I have Global Entry and Clear, so TSA Precheck always shows on my boarding pass whenever I've flown with Delta. Except for this time. This is saved to my Delta profile and always shows on my boarding pass when I've flown before, and when I've flown with other airlines. But not during the busiest travel weekend. And the ticket agents act bored and surely, and shrug there's nothing they can do. So don't count on your security status when flying Delta. Delta, thanks for nothing."

I didn't know I had messed up until I was being dropped off at the airport as I had forgotten my phone and had to drive back to pick it up at my house. Anyway, I do not fly much, I don't own a credit card (I am an unpaid family caretaker) as I cant afford bills. The money I had in my bank account is what I had including tbe cash in my wallet. Anyway, the assistant at the service desk I encountered was empathic, non-judgmental, caring and real. I unfortunately forgot the gals name, so sorry. Just kind of how may day is going. As once I was at the boarding gate I opened a soda and it sprayed all over me and everything. The person two chairs away acted like he didn't see it happen..

931,9,22,November,2019,Business Class,Detroit , Calgary , Minneapolis      ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Los Angeles to Orlando. I was on a Delta flight back home from Los Angeles after my grandfather passed. I payed a lot of money because this was a last min trip. I was traveling with my 4 month old baby girl. I had to change her diaper asap. I was closer to the front and they were giving out snacks and drinks at the back so I could not really go through to the back. So when I was heading to the front bathroom, the male flight attendant told we to wait aside (with his hand) so I waited, one person came out the bathroom, as soon as that happens another person from first class goes in and he sees her. She comes out, a second person gets up and goes into the bathroom, ( I canâ€™t get to the bathroom fast enough as he made me wait behind the first class section) then a third first class person goes in front of me. At that point Iâ€™m getting upset because this flight attendant knows Iâ€™ve been waiting there - then I ask if the changing table is located in side the bathroom, Iâ€™ve never changed a diaper in an airplane before so I donâ€™t know. He replies by telling me â€œI supposeâ€œ But because Iâ€™m not first class he doesnâ€™t nothing to help, and he was Very nice to the first class so I can see heâ€™s got potential to be nice to me as well if I would of paid extra for first class. I finally was able to get to the bathroom to change my baby. 2 hrs later, I had to use the restroom. Again, I have to go to the front. Then I ask him if itâ€™s being used. He replyâ€™s with â€œI donâ€™t know, what do you see the sign sayâ€? With a very rude attitude. He was just over all a very rude flight attendant. Iâ€™ve been in many many flights and Iâ€™ve never been treated like a peasant. I guess I can expect this from spirit, frontier , or American, but Not United. I just rather fly the other airlines, itâ€™s not worth the money they charge if they wonâ€™t treat you nice."

933,10,22,November,2019,Economy Class,Columbus , Guatemala City , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Denver to Atlanta. My flight was supposed to take off at 1:19 pm, we all boarded and the second I put my butt on the uncomfortable no leg room seat, they made us deplane. The pilot said it would be two hours, the kiosk lady said it would be 20 minutes, we kept hearing confusing details. We took off after 3 pm, almost 2 hours late because of a hydraulic problem, whatever that means. To top it off, there was no food! Because they couldnâ€™t tell us when we would board, everyone sat on the floor in the terminal waiting, so we couldnâ€™t go get food, and the flight had no food. I missed my connecting flight, the flight attendants were rude, they had no food."
934,3,21,November,2019,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Germany,Not Verified ,"  On our trip from Boston to Frankfurt we had to change planes in NY. We went from La Guardia to JFK, where we had to pass through security again. About 30 minutes before boarding I realized that my passport was not there anymore. I went to the Delta counter where a very friendly and efficient lady explained to me that without my passport I would not be allowed to travel. She recommended that I or my wife should go all the way back to security where they have their own lost and found. To cut a long story short: My wife went there and the passport had been found. Back at the counter we were told that boarding had been closed and that it was impossible for us to get on that plane. And then the miracle happened: the agent organized everything for us. She put us on the same flight 24 hours later, booked a hotel room for us, breakfast, taxi - all we needed. And it didnÂ´t cost us a dollar. All this was paid for by Delta. Our nightmare had turned into a wonderful experience of excellent service, kindness and understanding. They would not have to do this as it was our own fault, after all. We are more than grateful to Elizabeth. A wonderful lady and a great airline!"

If Delta is intent on becoming a 4-star airline, I hope they get there soon. I never thought I would live to say this, but after my two experiences with Delta international new service, I am going to actually search Delta tickets over most European airlines, and reasons for that are many and concern the basic comforts required to be able to sustain flying long hours in a metal canister. We were positively shocked to receive a welcoming cocktail - in basic economy - and one of our favorite cocktails, peach Bellini. The cabin crew ran rounds with water and soft drinks, and also several rounds with hot drinks and alcohol. The wine is not bad at all. They give hot towels before meals. Food has been improved, too, and the white grape, cheese and toasted almond snack was delish, as was the salted caramel ice cream. The pizza twist served as a second snack was underwhelming, however, but pizza is not my favorite anyway. Nothing to object to cabin crew or pilots, they are up to the task, as they always have been, but the service and the little things that make up the 9 hours on the plane bearable, are much better. The flight was super smooth and we touched down on time. Finally, big thanx to the Delta ground crew at Amsterdam, who on their own initiative assigned us much better seats than the online system allowed us to reserve during online check-in. Much thanks, we enjoyed our seats."

Not only was my flight delayed (4) times but then when I got to my gate, I was told that the flight was to a different city. The customer service rep was rude when I showed him the discrepancy and told me to just sit down and wait for my flight. My father had heart surgery and a stroke shortly after the surgery and I really needed to be there. Thanks to the lack of organization and professionalism, I was not able to be present and am still waiting on my connecting flight info because apparently that is also incorrect."

First, there was nothing first class about this flight. I was offered a soft drink, coffee or other types of standard economy class drink before takeoff, In flight, I was offered the same drink with a snack of either nuts, cheez its, and other varieties like that. No meal service, not even a sandwich was offered. A friend of mine in economy had the same snack we had, in fact, he was given 3 bags of cheez its. The seat was roomy but not real clean, there were shoe scuffs on the bulkhead in front of me and the seat belt had seen better days, no in-flight entertainment although there was WIFI. This plane was in desperate need of refurbishment and upgrade. The only reason I upgraded to first class was that I had knee surgery a couple of weeks before the flight."

I got 10 minutes late in Seattle and I missed my second flight which was also with Delta. They put me in a flight with Alaska few hours later and the airline changed the gate 3 times til they cancelled the flight. Delta didnâ€™t even send me an email to let me know what was happening, it didnâ€™t update my flight on the app. I spent the whole night at the airport because Delta didnâ€™t give me any hotel or something like that. Such a poor service, Delta are so irresponsible with your clients. I wouldnâ€™t recommend at all. I called the Delta attendant and he didnâ€™t even find my confirmation system. He wanted to put me on a flight for 24 hours later. Was he kidding?"

No issues on the flight, it was pleasant and the cabin crew were friendly.

Being a traveling musician needed to take my guitar. Typically there is closet space but in this case was told guitar needed pink tag to go under plane. While the crew assured me my guitar ($1000 Martin) would be in good hands it was severely cracked when I got home. Claim was denied with poor service. They did offer very minute repair fee after I complained again. Not nearly enough to cover my guitar which is needed for living. Also flight was delayed and there was no flow to boarding process. Being a gold member and spending thousands throughout the years one would think there would be better respect. So all in all Delta pretends to be good service until you need them most.
943,1,14,November,2019,Economy Class,Detroit , Amsterdam        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Daytona Beach to Austin via Atlanta. I have used Delta for many years, however my last (4) trips flown with the company has been hindered with issue after issue. Though I have tried to reconcile these issues with the company and have been gifted several vouchers (which i have not used) it seems that the issues mentioned do not get corrected. My last flight was Nov. 10, 2019 flying home from spending my birthday with friends and family. the flight was set to board at 7:35pm and depart at 8:15pm. At the gate it was announced that the airline was awaiting the arrival of the captain and co-captain to arrive and boarding was pushed back 20-30 minutes. This is understandable ... boarding started at or around 8:10pm whereas it was around 8:30 by the time Main Cabin 1 was called to board. Around 20 minutes after sitting in my seat the flight attendants cam over the PA stating that they had no update on the whereabouts of the captain and co- captain and thanked everyone for their patience (8:50pm). 20 minutes later the Captain announced his sincerest apologies and explained he had just flown in with the NFL team and had been stranded on the tarmac for some time before catching a ride over to our plane (9:10pm). He added that checks still had to be made prior to the flight and we should be taking off in around 25-30 minutes. At 9:34 pm we pushed away from the gate prepared for take off and that the flight would take two hours and fourteen minutes from take off to touch down, then another delay as we were declared number 3 for take off. The flight landed in Orlando after midnight however by the time we were able to exit the plane was more closer to 1am. We had prepaid parking set for 11pm retrieval. At 1:15am we picked up our vehicle and started our hour and fifteen minute drive home (2:30am). We both had to work in the early morning, myself at 5:00 am. Delta's form of understanding how much adverse effects can have for having such poor service... $75.00! This is the gratitude the company feels is adequate for its customers."
944,10,13,November,2019,Economy Class,Lexington , Key West , Atlanta     ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,  Delta staff on this flight were very nice and treated customers with care. I can count on them to always provide good service and on time-departures. Detroit seems like an easy hub to connect through and Raleigh is so convenient to get through as an airport. Awesome job Delta! 
945,10,13,November,2019,Economy Class,Atlanta , Cincinnati       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Canada, Trip Verified ," Detroit to Calgary via Minneapolis. Due to poor road conditions, no drivers were willing to take me to the airport for my early morning flight despite trying Lyft, Uber, and calling every taxi company in the area from 4 AM until after 6 AM. When someone was finally willing to take me, it was too late and I missed my flight. Upon I arriving at the airport, I told a customer service agent I missed my flight and don't know what to do, and she immediately was very kind and comforting. She directed me to a desk and reassured me it would be sorted out. The agent at the desk was extremely compassionate, and despite the fact that I had only paid for an economy fare ticket and did not purchase the flexible fare, he did not charge me for changing my flight and got me a seat on the next plane. He also kindly reassured me that everything would be fine and I would be able to get home. I was the last one to board the plane and it departed right away. I am so thankful that they waited for me and that they were so kind as to not charge me again. They were within their rights to charge me again, but they treated me kindly like a person rather than just another source of profit. Great service, friendly and kind agents, big fan of their in-flight entertainment system as well as the free wi-fi for in-flight messaging purposes. I also like that they still give both cookies and crackers on the short flights, whereas other airlines I've flown with only offer beverages now. The only downside is the seat cushions are not well padded in economy, but you get what you pay for. I have rarely flown with Delta in the past, but I would definitely fly with them again."
946,10,11,November,2019,Business Class,Baltimore , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Orange County to Minneapolis. Very disappointed with Delta. I was told I needed to check my carry on. I adhered to the rules of a carry-on and a personal item yet they allowed another person before me to board with four (yes, 4) bags. I believe the rules should be followed by everyone. I can understand my checking my bag as itâ€™s necessary but everyone should follow the same rules. Check her 2 additional bags."

Inbound arrived 17 minutes early, outbound 5 minutes early. Service was fine, clean planes, snacks were good. WiFi was spotty and pricey if you wanted to do more than watch movies or use iMessenger.

Took 4 Delta flights in 10 days, 3 of them had major issues. TLH had no ready GPU/APU to pull  40 min delay. To make it worse, gate agent unfamiliar with ITI procedures could not check my bag to YYZ, instead had me take ATL train six stops to domestic bag claim, run to slow International terminal F shuttle, only to arrive at Air Canada checkin counter closed. I had to buy a $500 ticket from Delta to go home. Original ATL transit time was 2+ hours - Missed bag, AC/DL at ATL, onward to TLH baggage handlers/Delta had 1.5 hours to transfer bag. - Delta delayed 1403 Panama City to ATL 4 times, maintenance issues I missed Halloween with my family."

The Delta rep at the service counter wouldn't give me my boarding passes all the way to Rabat, nor would they give my seat assignments.

951,9,9,November,2019,Premium Economy,Newark , Munich        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ," Jacksonville to Rochester via Boston. Delta took $326.86 dollars from me on an ""economy"" deal. I attempted to change the 11-22 flight on 10-7. I was not looking for a refund but literally could not make the 11-22 flight and was seeking a credit to change flight days. Delta coldly refused (I have never tried to change a flight with anyone). Delta is a cold, callous corporation that is unfeeling toward its customers, and I will never book a flight with Delta again. I couldn't be more disgusted if I tried."
952,1,8,November,2019,Economy Class,Seattle , Kona        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Accra to Tampa via New York. I have been a Delta platinum member for years and Delta has lost my bag and is not doing anything about it. I arrived at JFK from Accra, retrieved my 3 suitcases and re-checked them in to Tampa only for me to receive just 2 bags in Tampa. Customer service has been useless on how to handle the situation and no one calls back when they say they will. Iâ€™ve had to go to the airport every day for 2 weeks straight and also sent someone in JFK to go to Delta baggage services personally only for them not to be able to help. I ended up having to file a claim and Delta is asking for receipts of all my stuff in the bag-which is ridiculous because how do they expect me to have receipts for items purchased years ago? Did I ask for my bag to be lost? The claims manager never answers his phone or returns messages. This is so unacceptable and Iâ€™ve had enough of this nonsense. I paid so much for my ticket-not to mention all my valuables inside the suitcase which Delta compensate me for. I need my bag back and Delta at this point feels they can be careless and pay me off (which they cannot because they would give me way less than what everything costs) and get away with it. Me and my family have only flown Delta for so many years but I will probably have to switch to a different airline now because I am so disappointed."
953,3,7,November,2019,Economy Class,Atlanta , Frankfurt        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,  Seattle to Spokane. My flight got delayed 5 different times. They were going to have me take a late flight to my destination when I had originally had an afternoon flight. They eventually had to get a completely different plane to come to the airport to do the flight. Ridiculous. I will never fly Delta again.
954,9,4,November,2019,Economy Class,Louisville , Newport News , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Great customer service. I took Delta from SJC to Eugene and back again and both trips I had a scheduled stop in Seattle to change planes. Of the 4 total flights, 3 of them left right on time and got me to my destinations early. The fourth flight (Seattle to SJC) ended up getting delayed about 2 hours. However, in addition to courtesy texts and emails informing me of the delay and apologizing, they apologized to all of us again at the gate about an hour out from boarding and offered all of us free snacks and drinks. Delays are a reality of air travel, but my experience with Delta showed me that they work hard to avoid delays and even harder to make up for them if they occur. Things like free snacks may be a small gesture, but they really go a long way in showing they care. Great experience overall."

My flights are booked far out using a 3rd party vendor. I request seat selections based upon availability at the booking time, but I always end up in the middle on super lengthy flights. Then, because I travel with a smaller carry-on bag, I'm expected to put it under my seat. I'm in the middle, I don't have arm space or leg room by the time, I slide the bag under the seat. Military probably gets discounted rates which is why Delta probably doesn't take seat selection into consideration. It's business travel, and it absolutely sucks with Delta. Anytime I can fly American, I will."

I would discourage anyone needing to get to their destination on the same day as promised when purchasing tickets to avoid Delta. Delta claimed ""bad weather"" as a reason they could not land in Atlanta. However, our connecting flight took off during this extended period of 'bad weather.' They also lied about rebooking us on the next available flight. They also lied about having customer service representatives available at the gate upon arrival. They prevented a wedding party from attending the rehearsal for a destination wedding. If your travel plans matter to you, don't choose Delta."

Observation the number of people who are bringing 2-3 bags. And they seem to be larger than might work. When you are in the comfort+ and you board when you should you would expect to be able to have overhead space for a cpap machine. I put my backpack in the seat in front of me. This wasnâ€™t the case it had to be put all the way in the back. I think you should be addressing the carry one issue.

I fly Delta weekly as I have not much choice flying between BWI and JFK and it honestly gets worse every week. Always an issue, never board or take off on time. As I type this I am sitting in yet another aircraft with a mechanical issue and the mechanic wonâ€™t be here for at least a half hour. Flights constantly delayed or cancelled. Funny though, if I opt for American Airlines, I donâ€™t seem to have these issues. Very frustrating after all the money Iâ€™ve spent with these folks. Although not as convenient, Iâ€™m making the switch to American after today."
961,1,26,October,2019,Economy Class,Amsterdam , Detroit        ,Direct Flight,Business,Singapore, Trip Verified ,"  Delta repeatedly has bad ground and customer service staff. The breaking point which compelled me to write a feedback on this airline after flying with them for so many years came when they did not handle my luggage professionally. When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it. Its better to take your money to other airlines who would respect and treat premium or frequent fliers more seriously."

Bad experience with Delta, for a strange reason, was my baggage to heavy (3 kg) this is strange because on the KLM flight the weight of my baggage was not too heavy. I must pay $100 extra for my baggage so the total amount for 3 pieces of baggage was $190.00. Never Delta airlines for me."

We had connecting flights both departing and returning back to New Jersey from Munich. Everything ran smoothly. We did have to retrieve our baggage on our return flight because of international customs but Delta had an place in the Detroit departure area to drop off luggage and forward them to Newark. It was effortless. The flight attendants made the time on both flights remarkably comfortable. Blankets and pillows were available. They were attentive to our needs. Warm moist cloths were given before our 2 meals to freshen up. Beverages were served several times and cups of water offered frequently. Snacks were served and offered when we wanted, the flight attendants seemed to truly enjoy their job. The captains let us know what was going on especially when we had a weather delay flying back to Newark. It was nice to hear why we were being held back from landing and for how long instead of wondering what was happening or how long we would be circling. We will not hesitate to choose Delta/KLM in the future. As stressful as flying can be the Delta crew made it an amazing journey."

They had pillows and blankets and little televisions in the seats and you can track your flight. The pilot kept us updated. I literally will only fly Delta from now on. On our way home we flew Alaska and I was extremely upset that it was such a downgrade. I was shivering and freezing cold the entire flight as was my son and husband and we were in long sleeves and pants. No pillows, no blankets, you had to pay to use the tablets, staff were snotty. Thank you Delta for the good experience."

I have decided to fly with another airline going forward just because my overall experience with Delta is simply too frustrating. I was also pretty unhappy with the unreasonable 1st checked baggage fee. Also my not being able to choose my seat during check-in. And when I asked the agent to change it for me in Frankfurt he simply had no interest in helping me. Food was also unsatisfactory. My opinion at this point is that Delta is simply not worth the headache. FYI: the changes Delta has made are clearly not geared toward passenger satisfaction.

Never mind the people who didn't listen to the announcement of please sit if you do not have a connecting flight in less than an hour. Now we are out 8 hours of our destination and 200 dollars to have to taxi from another town we are flying into. I will not book flight with Delta again.

It seems they could do it more efficiently but would rather annoy everyone. Thereâ€™s never enough room to put your carry on because they donâ€™t enforce carry on size. One suitcase will fill an overhead bin where three carry ons should go. I had to sit with my legs crossed in my seat for my whole flight - very uncomfortable. The staff on the flight is not  courteous or helpful. And who thinks some wheat cheezits are good? Very disappointed. Itâ€™s like each flight gets worse and worse. Itâ€™s almost worth taking your chances of getting pulled out of your seat and just going with another airline.

I arrived to the airport ahead of schedule about 1 to go thru processing & enough time for my flight. The plane arrived, the passengers got off & we started boarding the plane about 4:45. While sitting for about 30 minutes the stated they was looking into some things & would update shortly. It was after 7 before they came advising we had to get off the plane, it couldn't fly because of navigation that our flight would leave at 9. While sitting & waiting the pilot comes on to say sorry folks I can't fly you out at 9 that he would reach his 20 hours so trying to round up a crew to fly out at 1:20. Everyone all upset so they start putting people in hotels & getting a taxi. The guy in front of me got the last room available so only other recourse would be pay out of pocket ourselves. I advised that I had an event that morning in Bryon at 11am was there any other flights so I was eventually able to grab a standby. My ticket says wheelchair assistance because I cant do all of the walking in the airport due to disability. So I get to Atlanta airport no wheelchair & to top things off my baggage with all my things I needed was no where to be found. I fill out a baggage claim. Saturday evening my baggage was delivered. I submit a complaint online thru Delta to get a response by email saying they was sorry & unfortunately couldn't assist. My thought process is after everything I had been thru for an airline to not think enough to at least pick up the phone to call your customer was just as bad as the entire experience on Friday. Unbelievable Delta, really unbelievable! Not to mention the entire time sitting on the plane did you offer crackers or juice will everyone sitting there cramped up & uncomfortable."

Check-in on line impossible, stating that a change had occurred and that I was allowed to amend my flight at no extra cost. Not a real option as the rest of the trip had already been booked and partially paid for. Arriving at the check-in counter at Amsterdam Airport we got different seats than booked. Explanation: Delta had flown in with a different aircraft. But we were assured that we would nonetheless have Comfort Plus seats being â€˜the equivalent of Premium Selectâ€™. This is, of course, not the case: The difference between Comfort Plus and Premium Select is 4 inches of legroom less, no leg support and no 7 degrees more reclining seats; a smaller screen and no personalized service etc. Features reflected in the price difference. The big blow, however, came inside the plane. One can try to call any seat a Comfort Plus seat, but not a main cabin seat with 9 instead of 8 abreast. Also, dinner came on the same tray and with the same quality as the rest of the cabin, The menu circulated in advance was clearly marked â€˜International Main Cabinâ€™. Checking the safety instructions in the seat pocket, it turned out that the plane in question was a Boeing 777-200 in a configuration not available on Deltaâ€™s web site. Probably an older version, because my table was hanging toward me, making my food tray almost landing on my lap. What I reproach Delta most of all is that they were not straightforward. A plane replacement might happen. In that case it would have been correct to let Premium Select passengers know, with excuses and an offer to compensate for the inconvenience. This has not happened."

I was so worried I wouldn't make it but the flight attendant on the flight coming into Atlanta assured me they would wait for me, but I still ran my heart out to the next gate. They had just called for last boarding call and the plane was still there. I explained i had no baggage and am military and really needed to board three plane. It was 2124 and the plane was scheduled to depart at 2131. The lady told me she hears the ""military excuse"" but there's nothing to be done. I understand there is a schedule but this was the last flight into Fayetteville. Every other airline, like southwest, will hold the plane for a small amount of time for passengers with small delays. Delta ruined my chance of getting home before work and I will rethink flying with them again. I want a company that supports thir passengers, especially when that company is the cause of the delay."

Donâ€™t ever trust your luggage in the hands of this incompetent company. My wife and I purchased a brand new away bag since our old luggage had seen its better days. We bring it with us for the first time and while checking our bag the lady behind the counter literally threw our luggage and bounced it off the wall and onto the conveyor belt. We mention that was rude and she apologizes. Then we get to our destination and our bag isnâ€™t there to greet us. Great. Glad thatâ€™s the second time in a row we have been without our luggage in 2 trips. Delta batting 1000 right there. Fast forward 2 days we get our bag to the airport and the baggage guy in Phoenix is a little more careful with our bag but not much. We get home finally and our zipper is destroyed, our name tag is completely ripped and the  new bag is scratched. Naturally, we decide to speak to a Delta representative at this point and he informs me itâ€™s minor damage and that itâ€™s probably not worth my time to make a claim since Delta surely wonâ€™t do anything about it anyways.

I will never fly Delta again after what I went through here in Tokyo. Understandably they canceled flights for Saturday October 12th due to a typhoon, but our flight was the following afternoon - all Delta flights on Sunday and Monday are canceled despite the fact that the typhoon has passed by Sunday morning and the majority of other airlines are flying this afternoon and tomorrow. Instead of compensating us for the extra 3 days we are stranded in Tokyo or adding additional flights they are absolving themselves of any blame and forcing their customers to pay over $500 out of pocket for the multiple days we are stranded in Japan. Youâ€™re a multi billion dollar corporation and you canâ€™t even offer your customers some kind of compensation when you made a mistake and canceled flights far too early? Itâ€™s disappointing but enlightening because it showed me the type of airline you are and youâ€™ll never get another dollar from me."

My flight landed at 830pm at ATL so I could hit a connecting flight at 9:07. We weren't able to unload because another plane was at the gate we were suppose to pull into. Instead of pulling into a different gate, we sat there for 20 minutes. We finally got to a gate and it wasn't until 9PM that the first person was able to get off the flight. They promised that nobody would miss their connecting flights. Turns out they did not do anything to prevent this. My flight to BMI took off at 9:02PM (suppose to be 9:07PM). I got to the gate at 9:09PM with no plane in sight. There were countless other people who had missed flights due to this airline. The best part was it was a gorgeous day out so it was really just their lack of commitment, maintenance, and planning by the airport. I wish I could create a work environment where I just have to say, ""I'm sorry for not being able to achieve what I said would happen but here are the reasons"". I ended up sleeping at the airport as I imagined I'd get less than 8 hours of sleep if I went to their ""discounted"" hotel (not free), go through security at a big airport, and weave my way around of a mass amount of people to get to my gate. Summary is I missed my grandma's funereal because a company can't uphold it's scheduling. The good news is they got me there eventually, got me a ticket to the next flight, and I was able to see my family. Please never put your faith in this company. Always make sure there's another flight after and if there is, understand that you still might not get onto that flight because it was all already booked. Always look at the airport's policy on missed flights. You'll be amazed at what they can get away with when compared to EU flights."

They told me I had to buy a whole other ticket ($200). I couldnâ€™t take the meeting from the airport because my computer died and I needed my charger which I left at home on accident, besides I didnâ€™t think I would need it. I was already having a bad day and Delta made it worse with their bad customer service. They told me that purchasing another ticket was all I could do, but then after pleading with the customer service rep they told me I could stand on standby and pay an additional fee if there were additional seats on the plane. If they said that first, this all could have been avoided. $75 charge for stand-buy, on my top of the $170 ticket."

Dinner was a chicken dish which was tasty, sandwich snack (turkey if I remember) was ok. Breakfast was a pastry and yogurt. All were good no issues at all.

Right now, It's my fourth ticket and I swear that I'll never ever take this airline again. Customer Service is really important in a company.

The red eye flight was late, full, and the captain apologized that the WiFi was not working. Just as well as I slept most of the time. One really annoying thing in the cabin was that the temperature set too low and even though I had a blanket I was cold. Normally, I tend to get hot on a plane and it was one of the few times I got cold. Fortunately, I had a sweater for this kind of situations and I got to sleep without freezing. The plane landed on time. I cannot comment on IFE or food as i did not get to view and eat them respectively. I think I do remember is that the flight attendants were ok, not being rude or disinterested. Based on some of the other reviews I am thinking the crew was a more professional than normal.

Lining up to get checked in at one of the economy counters, the Delta worker told us to go to the premium check-in counters on the other side which had far fewer people. The lady at the counter processed us quickly and we were making our way to the security line. So, that was a good start to our journey back to Seattle. The flight left on time and as it departed late afternoon, I got to eat a meal on Delta and it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was average quality airline food. The IFE was reasonable for a domestic route. The typical reviews I read of US-based airlines mention how terrible the flight attendants are. However, the flight crew on this flight was professional and courteous. So, I thought I was fortunate to get a good crew. Upon reading little more on the US based airlines, it seems Delta has a better operation and more motivated workforce than American or United. Well, I hope they keep improving as all of them have a long way to go to compete effectively with many of the Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. If it wasn't for the US government protecting the domestic market for these carriers from their overseas competitors, they would have stopped operating long time before they went through their multi-year bankruptcy. Sorry, I am digressing from the flight experience. Overall, I enjoyed the flight back to Seattle and the experience was better than I expected. So, I was content that it was uneventful, landed on time, and I didn't lose my luggage."

I was on my way to an important out of state interview and I had a very narrow time gap to shoot, so I thought I'd choose Delta to be safe because I was under the impression they were more reliable. There was a lay over in LAX. We landed on time but proceeded to sit for an hour and a half on the runway due to construction. We sat there so long that our connecting flight left without us. There were at least 5 other passengers on the flight scheduled for the same connecting flight to Columbus. By the time we got off the plane we had 20 min to get across the airport to make our flight. We told all the Delta employees on our flight and at the arrival gate to communicate to the other gate that we were coming. One other passenger even called in to Delta. We got there 5 min before the actual departure time, and they hadnâ€™t held the plane. They left without all of us! The departing gate employees claimed they never received any kind of info from the other gate. Finally we were forced to get rebooked for another flight, the service desk ladies were extremely slow, uncooperative, and rude. The soonest Delta could get us to our destination was 6 hours after our initial scheduled arrival. The service was terrible. No one was helpful. No vouchers were offered or any kind of effort to make things better. We almost missed the back up plan flights because they took so long to get our flights changed."

LA to Boston round trip was an internationally configured 757 with Delta One service. While the layout on the 767 allowed for me to sit alone, the food etc was not quite as good as the Delta One flights. The Delta One 757 offered very comfortable 2x2 seating with upgraded service such as amenity kits..etc. On all flights the attendants were friendly and terrific, the entertainment plentiful and the experiences were all excellent.

I have tried calling the corporate line 3 times and no answer. I sent them a complaint requesting a call back, nothing. So now Iâ€™ll share my experience with everyone I can. Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didnâ€™t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer. I was so frustrated that my friends I was traveling with decided to call as I was getting really frustrated. My screen did not work on the way to Hawaii. My wifeâ€™s screen did not work on the way back. I cannot believe the lack of customer support. Any business I can think of that I have had a negative experience with has tried to rectify the negative experience. I feel you have to beg for help with Delta. I personally feel Delta does not care about its customers. A follow up call or apology coming from Delta would have been highly appropriate. Frankly if I had this type of experience at my business weâ€™d bend over backwards to make it right. Delta has not done squat! I think they figure theyâ€™re big enough it really doesnâ€™t matter. Hopefully my feedback online everywhere I can think of will make a difference? Highly unlikely I think!"

Just after take-off all of the passengers in premium and economy got complimentary breakfast, the sausage was a little cold but the scrambled eggs were great.

The worst experience I have had on a flight ever. We came 3 hours early and was forced to check in our carry on bags as some other passengers used our storage. The seat I was given had a broken seat belt and I was not checked on so at all so that was a safety hazard. The nightmare started when the flight was delayed. They were boarding groups 1 and 2 but a bunch of people who were from group 3 cut in and nobody checked. Our group followed the rules by waiting for the group we were assigned and it was a big mistake! All the storage was taken so we were forced to check our carry on bags. Staff were also very unorganized, unprofessional and never apologized. One of them at the front desk told me ""you can wait for another later flight but it was already 11pm"" when I had commented about our situation which was rude and made the situation worse. Then when we sat my seat belt was broken and no one checked. Then the flight attendant completely skipped our row for drinks and ignored us. After an hour of waiting and being patient for the hope that one flight attendant would notice my husband hit the button to calmly explain that we were skipped for drinks. We never received any apology for anyone and were treated as second class passengers. I always believed that Delta airlines had an exceptional reputation with excellent customer service but my opinion has now changed. Our experience after paying nearly $600 was not of an airline with high standards instead it felt like a cheap discount airline like Spirit or Frontier with terrible customer service. So sad and never again we will try to fly with you we will go with American or United the next time we travel."

When did Delta Airlines become such a bad company? Checked in exactly 24 hours before my flights from FLL-ATL-BOG but only got one seat assignment. Called DL and they told me it was because I'd ""chosen"" a long connexion (their website offered it to me). I pointed out that in IATA area one a connexion is 12 hours so why did it not check me in for my connexion? No useful response. Was told to check-in again 24 hours before connexion flight. I did so and got a seat assignment but no boarding pass. Asked at counter at FLL and was told again it was due to long connexion time and that I should just check-in a fourth time at the gate. I did so and registered my dissatisfaction at having to check-in four times and this unpleasant woman said there was no reason why I shouldn't have been given a boarding pass in Atlanta when I asked for one. Delta advertised a dinner on the flight from ATL-BOG but it was a cold snack (turkey sandwich, two apple slices, and a small chunk of chocolate). To list this as a dinner  flight you must serve a hot meal. This is false advertising. In-flight entertainment was good. The cabin crew never broke into a smile not even a ""Pan-Am Smile."" The flight was very cheap though so I guess I paid a Spirit Airlines fare so I got Spirit Airlines service. A note to US carriers: we Americans have bony bums so need a cushion to sit on -- your seats feel like you're sitting on a wooden board."

1002,2,13,September,2019,Premium Economy,New York La Guardia , Halifax       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  About a week ago I decided to book a one-way flight with Delta out of Bismark to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket. Unfortunately for me, issues arose I can no longer take this flight. I tried to cancel the flight online, which I did, trying to get my refund, which I didn't. I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no. Not only that, but the representative on the phone sounded just as frustrated as I was. Lesson learned: I have to click two or three different links to learn what exactly what a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee"" is. On top of that, I should know not to trust what a big company shows at face value. Even if for some odd reason I would get the chance to take this flight, I wouldn't. I will never fly with Delta if I can avoid it. I wish I would have done my research in advance, or I would have seen all the bad reviews they had."

You can get it at the sky bridge with your ticket.â€ Then itâ€™s time to connect and they overbooked the flight (per usual). I stay in Seattle because I have business here. so I ask them to go get the bag they promised me. Fiona at the counter was great and went to get my bag. She tells me I can pick it up at the baggage claim. I go there and find it in the company of the least friendly of all Delta employees. Finally, (I think) weâ€™re reunited! Not so fast. The chick at the counter proceeds to tell me they are not allowed to short check bags and I cannot collect my bag. Naturally, she says this 2-3 times before I beg her to give me a solution. She tells me to proceed to ticketing so i can buy a new ticket to Seattle and collect my bag there. When I get to ticketing, I explain my story for the 3rd time. She explains that she needs to call global before permitting my bag return. So she calls global and insists I pay a fee to collect my bag. 45 minutes later and extra $$$ I have my carry on. Had any of the employees explained there may be an extra fee or a ridiculous process I may not have been so fuming mad. But they didnâ€™t, nor did they have any compassion on my situation that was ultimately their problem. To be honest, I will go out of my way to never fly Delta again."

We were incredibly disappointed with our Delta experience. On 9/2/19, we were scheduled to take DELTA 322 from Dallas to LaGuardia, our flight was delayed prior to take off but was supposed to arrive on time, however, we were rerouted to Norfolk right before landing in NYC. We eventually made it to LaGuardia but missed our connecting flight to BTV. The next flight out of LaGuardia was around 9:30pm on 9/3/19 which was not acceptable. We spoke to an agent who found a flight out of JFK (DELTA 5120) leaving at 12:15pm on 9/3/19. When we arrived at LaGuardia, we sought out a Delta representative and explained our situation, he gave us a â€œdistressed passengerâ€ voucher for a hotel. We called the number and the only hotel available was the Crown Plaza - we were required to pay $231.85 (which was apparently the discounted rate). We then had to spend $40 on transportation from LaGuardia to JFK at 1am. The receptionist at the Crown Plaza stated that she had never heard of an airline making customers pay for their hotel room due to airline error/delays. We were not the only customers flying with Delta at this hotel who has this issue. Not only did we incur nearly $300 of unexpected/unnecessary expenses but we also lost a day worth of work and animal care fees. We are absolutely unsatisfied with Delta and the way in which this was handled."
1008,5,8,September,2019,Economy Class,San Antonio , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Beijing to Seattle. Delta is flying 15-year-old airliners. That sounds pretty old, and it is. Our seats felt like they had come out of someone's neglected car. On our China-bound flight, we were without the in-flight entertainment system for much of the flight. What was displayed was the ""rebooting"" routine. Once up and running, the entertainment consisted of a dozen, or so, uninteresting movies; along with some very brief documentaries. The music selection consisted of 30 minutes of your chosen genre. On a ten hour flight, 30 minutes of music is a pretty bad plan. On our return flight, ten days later, we were fortunate to have the entertainment up and running during most of the flight, but the entertainment was identical. Both my wife and I ended up watching the same film on both legs of the trip. Food is about as awful as I've seen on any airline. We knew enough to bring lots of our own food with us. Our ""comfort plus"" seating included meals that our boys didn't touch. Less than two hours into the return flight I very politely requested a few cartons of milk for our little ones, and learned that there were none. They apparently had only loaded twenty 4oz cartons of milk onto the plane to provide for 198 passengers for over 10 hours. I actually had three flight attendants show up at my seat to scold me, saying ""We're not 7-Eleven."" In my decades of flying, this was the first time that I was actually scolded after politely requesting a carton of milk! We chose Delta because of a very different experience than we had with the airline about six years ago. This will be our last time with Delta."

We were rescheduled the next day and lied to the whole time about seating. We couldnâ€™t get seat assignments until 45 minutes before flight. Needless to say we were scattered all over the plane. We finally got to Sydney late missed connecting by 15 minutes to our destination. So we spent the day at the airport."

Delta is not committed to passenger safety or quality service. Our flight from JFK to Ponta Delgada on 8/8/19 & 8/9/19 was canceled and then delayed for over 24 hours. This was due to an inability to replace crews that had timed out and a failure to do a maintenance check on the aircraft which was flying in the air and then required to return back to the US before entering foreign territory. Delta customer service representative was unapologetic, combative and informed us that Delta engages in the practice of flying aircrafts without proper maintenance checks. They did not wish to compensate passengers in any way other than offering a pathetic amount of skymiles to fly them again. We had to practically threaten to sue to just get a $200 credit yet our costs incurred for transportation, food, lodging and the mental anguish was a greater amount."

But instead, Delta airlines held us on the runway for more than an hour waiting on a single maintenance person to come in and spend literally 2 minutes fixing one of the bathrooms. We waited an entire hour, which made the entire plane which was almost all connections late, for one bathroom to be fixed for a 2 hour flight. The worst service imaginable, now people who were supposed to fly at 10 AM are all being delayed to 3 PM flights, or 5 or even 9. And tomorrow is Labor Day, so some people are actually just stuck here in Atlanta. The worst airline service Iâ€™ve ever received, absolutely no urgency or care for the customers. Never fly Delta if you want to arrive on time."

Delta actually has a pretty good product once you're on the plane. Seats are comfortable, they have TVs, and the snacks are pretty good. Flight attendants are hit or miss, my first flight had surly ones, while on the second flight they were outstanding. But the ground experience is where Delta fails miserably. They now board international flights 50 minutes early, so I got a series of urgent texts and phone notifications telling me to go to my gate immediately, which stressed me out because my connecting flight was late and I was a terminal away. I rushed to get on the plane only to sit there for another half hour while waiting for all the other connecting passengers to come. I really resented being put in that position of stress when it wasn't necessary, and recommend that Delta put its boarding times later to give connecting passengers time to get there."

I booked this flight 6 weeks ago for me and my husband as part of our 20th anniversary vacation. Naturally I booked 2 seats together, 5C and 5D. Because I am 6â€™6â€, I planned to take the aisle seat on the cramped commuter jet. Everything was fine until while boarding the plane I was told â€œyour new seat is 7Aâ€. When I asked if my husbandâ€™s seat was also changed I was told it was not. When I said that was not acceptable (which I thought was obvious) I was told we could sit together in 7A and 7B. The problem was they failed to tell that to the person in 7B who was already on the plane. After attempting to get into 7A (a window seat) with minimal success, I sat in my original seat. At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation I was told I had been moved to accommodate other passengers who wished to sit together. Not OK. I have contacted Delta and am awaiting a response as to why they believe they have the right to discriminate against others in a country where that is illegal."

We are so ecstatic that this was the airline we were switched to and that we were diverted through Atlanta. Every single staff member was understanding of the pressure we felt to get to New York in time to see our Broadway show. I don't know if Delta will read this but Matilda at gate T3 on August 23 for the 130pm flight to New York deserves recognition. When we approached her to get information about our now delayed 230pm flight she knew we wouldn't make it in time for our show so she sent us to customer service where they put us as a priority on the stand by list for the 130pm flight which was on time no questions asked. When we got called to get our seats Matilda recognized us and celebrated with us that we were going to make our show. We were glad to have any seat but we were seated in economy plus (it feels like this was a gift from Matilda). When we left Toronto we felt defeated that we had lost a day and a half of our trip and getting to our Broadway show wasn't guaranteed not to mention we were met with horrible customer service. Delta truly saved our trip!

I don't usually fly Delta Air Lines as they don't have many routes in the city I live in. Having said that, every time I have flown with them (3x in the last 2 years), I found their staff to be courteous and helpful, their seats adequate (although a little hard), good leg room (I'm 6' 4""), and their app (reviewed in 2019) probably the best in the industry. Will fly again."

Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldnâ€™t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though â€œFinally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!â€ Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you donâ€™t have money, you are worthless and donâ€™t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldnâ€™t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasnâ€™t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business. Just earlier this year, I had traveled home with an economy airline to help move my grandmother into a nursing home. I had purchased a round trip, but my grandmother ended up passing away and I extended my stay through to my brothers wedding which I had already purchased flights for."

The first leg of our flight was delayed due to an exit sign missing off the plan. 4 hour delay because they could not find an exit sign to fix the problem. This caused a large number if people to miss connecting flights. Delta didnâ€™t care of the issue. Everyone I spoke with shrugged their shoulders and replied with an â€œwe canâ€™t helpâ€. For my wife and myself, we will miss our connecting flight to Jamaica. Our $1,000 a night resort wonâ€™t change our reservations because it is already booked past our date. Delta offers nothing to help correct this. Wish I had booked with airline that doesnâ€™t have plans falling apart and that arenâ€™t able to meet FFA regulations.

Two delays at San Diego resulting in 1 hour 15 minute delay, entering holding pattern 500 miles from destination, taxiing for more than 1/2 hour after arrival at JFK because Delta needed to find an unoccupied gate.

So I guess we're walking from Seattle to Spokane because we didn't realize these crooks require customers to pay an extra $15 per seat to ensure that you actually get a seat on the flight you paid for."

Plane landed on time and approached a gate that was already occupied. We were told we needed to wait until it unloaded passengers. Then we were told there was another plane ahead of us in the line to the gate. We waited some more until we were told that the plane needed to go to another gate. This is about 40 minutes later the we got off the plane. We were told to take a shuttle bus to the baggage claim. That bus filled up before we could board and we needed to wait for a second bus. The second bus arrived and before we boarded the dispatcher told us to get off at the 2nd stop. The bus driver and a second dispatcher argued about whether to wait for another flight to fill the bus before we departed. The driver did not want to wait so we left and at the second stop they switched drivers. The new driver refused to let us get off the bus. He proceeded to drive us back to where we started. We told the dispatcher what happened and he berated us for listening to the driver rather than sympathize with our being subjected to wasted time and confusion. We called Delta and related the story. The service person on the phone said 'What do you expect me to do about this?'. I said this is very poor service and is there some way we could be compensated. She disconnected me. Do not fly Delta.
1031,2,18,August,2019,Business Class,Detroit , St Louis       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Usually I have no complaints whatsoever flying with Delta, but this time I had the worst experience. Firstly my flight from Lansing Michigan to Detroit was fine. However my flight from Detroit to Atlanta had an hour and a half layover which was okay with me. As soon as I stepped off the plane from Lansing, I received an email that my flight would be delayed another hour which was okay with me once again. I had a connecting flight in Atlanta to Gulfport that departed at 9.38. My flight from Detroit was supposed to land in Atlanta at 7.48 didn't land there until 9.15. After sprinting to the gate after having to stare at a monitor for my gate number I hurriedly made my way to my gate only for them to announce that my flight departed 5 minutes early. I was in tears almost with how frustrated I was. I was trying to get to Mississippi to see my brother off before he got deployed and also celebrate his birthday before he left. Fortunately the flight attendant was able to give me a care pouch and a hotel room although I had no access to my luggage and my cellphone was dying. Eventually I made it to Gulfport and spent time with my brother before he left for deployment. On my way back home, my flight from Atlanta to Detroit was delayed once again causing me to miss my connecting flight home. My mother who was 50 plus years old drove at midnight to come and get me from Detroit airport because they wouldn't give me a hotel room for the night and wanted everyone to stay the night in the airport. There was no remorse when I called customer service and explained everything to them. They told me they'd get back to me in seven business days for my refund for the last of my trip and offered me a $25 gift card. This was by far the worst experience and I will more than likely never fly Delta again. I was better off flying Spirit. Delta Charges too much money for them to be treating their customer's like this. Never again."

I not only fly Delta, I pay for the sky club every year and I have a Delta American Express card. Even though I have to consider all airfare costs, all the time for my company, I prefer Delta and choose Delta whenever possible, until now. I have spent decades building up my points. Late nights, early mornings, delayed flights, 60+ overnight stays a year away from my family and more. Itâ€™s a lot of sacrifice to be able to take advantage of miles Iâ€™ve worked extremely hard for once or twice a year, only find out, Delta can manipulate markets and gauge customers like me and pull all those decades of earned miles right out of my pocket in an instance. And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancÃ© is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. Iâ€™ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. Weâ€™re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse youâ€™re having us leave an airport (Miami) we donâ€™t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover. To make matters worse my fiancÃ© can not afford to travel that day to Miami and back to Atlanta, because she only has a sitter for the Atlanta to Sau Paulo trip and weâ€™re struggling to find a way to keep her in Atlanta, even if I have to go out of my way to Miami, just to protect some of my hard earned points. If I was to transition her ticket to the Atlanta portion only, the cost to my personal point status is crippling. Iâ€™m writing to you because Iâ€™ve been loyal for decades. Iâ€™ve supported Delta for decades (flights. Credit cards, sky club, etc). Iâ€™ve never complained. Iâ€™ve supported you and now your fleecing my points because youâ€™re too rigid to solve this problem. I canâ€™t accept the negative impact Iâ€™m being subjected to, after all the sacrifice Iâ€™ve withstood to earn my points. I donâ€™t accept it. You tag line, printed on your napkin (see photo) states, 'the world is better without you in it'. What youâ€™re doing to me, my fiancÃ©, her daughter and our trip flies in the face of this tag line. Youâ€™re supposed to encourage us to venture out, travel, adventure, etc.. Not discourage us and penalize us. Iâ€™m not some one-timer. Look at my vast history. The fact that youâ€™re setting markets up for price gauging with a personal impact to someone like me, is completely opposed to your messaging. So if youâ€™re going to be an impediment to your own tag line, Iâ€™d suggest you stop using it."

My Husband and I celebrated our 1-year Anniversary and thanks to Delta to give us a horrible ending to our vacation. It first started in Miami where there were 2 or 3 delays for the flight from Miami to Atlanta, there were no announcements regarding why the delays were happening and no information given whatsoever. The weather was a little overcast sky, but that was it. Once we finally boarded the aircraft, we landed in Atlanta 15 minutes after our connected flight had already left. We were not sure what our next steps were, so we went to the Delta Help counter on Concourse A where we encountered a nasty, condescending, rude, disrespectful employee. It was bad enough that we were upset that we missed our flight, but to make matters worse to endure her and her unpleasant attitude. First of all, in Miami there was no reason given why our flight was delayed and then when we got to Atlanta we had to stay in the airport all night and were not compensated or reimbursed for anything, not so much as a blanket, a cup of coffee or water. I understand that things happen but to be treated in the matter of which we were is Unacceptable and definitely not customer-oriented or customer friendly, at all. From the first delay, where there were no updates, to the rude employee, to no compensation for anything, not to mention that my husband and I missed a day of work and missed wages and had to pay an extra day of parking at our original destination where we had parked and pre-paid. I definitely would not recommend your airline to anyone. Based on the unjust treatment and the lack of concern from your company and employee Lucille, I somehow, sincerely doubt that this complaint would be viewed or given any consideration, but I had to air my true disappointment in a company that I view totally different now."

Great gate staff who were able to assist us by confirming our pre-ordered vegetarian meals. Flight left on time! After take off two snacks (snack mix & biscoff cookies) and a drink from a selection of alcoholic or soft drinks were provided free of charge! Vegetarian meals were handed out a few minutes before the standard meals, meal was horrible, a vegetarian (not vegan) consisted of gluten free pasta, no dairy whatsoever, along with a salad and a gluten free bread roll. I would suggest vegetarians opt for the vegetarian meal that is provided onboard without needing to preorder. Asked for the other vegetarian meal that people who did not preorder got and it was great. Cabin crew were extremely attentive and did a drinks service every 45 minutes. About 2.5 hours before landing a vegetarian snack bag and burrito was handed out which were both decent. About 1 hour before landing ice cream was handed out.  I had lost my phone and had asked the cabin crew if it was okay if I could have a look for it at my seat they allowed me too and even helped me search for it. Had a nice conversation with the same member of cabin crew, one thing about Delta is they have outstanding staff. We collected our baggage which was fine and not damaged whatsoever. Would highly recommend Delta,  the best airline that I have flown."

My husband and I got married Saturday Aug 3, 2019. We planned our honeymoon following immediately after for Monday Aug 5th, 2019 to Saturday Aug 10th, 2019 to Oranjestad, Aruba. Though weâ€™ve never flew with Delta airlines before, there were no worries that our honeymoon would be amazing. When we arrived to the Delta check â€“ in , there was an older gentlemen who was kind enough to help get our luggage checked in, he stated that he had just sent us off to Aruba and that some sort of gratuity would be in order, we tipped him and went on our way. Things were running smooth, however, instead of departing at 7:00 am like our boarding passes stated, Delta flight 1080 to ATL start boarding at 7:00 am, which posed no issue at the time us, because my husband and I were present at the gate. Although boarding to ATL was passed time, the flight made good timing. We arrived in ATL at 9:50 am instead of 9:31am like our boarding passes and check in stated. My husband and I had assigned seats in the back of the plane, separately in rows 35 B and 35 F. It took a total of 20 minutes to get off the Delta flight 1080 from STL. We got off from our flight around 10:10 am, unlike other airlines we have been on, Delta requires you to go see a monitor for further instructions on boarding. My husband and I immediately went to the nearest monitor to locate the appropriate gate for our connecting flight to Aruba. In the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, there is a train that connects at each gate. The gate assembly starts at T, then A, B, C, D, E. it took my husband and I a total of 15 minutes to get from off flight 1080 to Gate T, then Gate E. GATE E 14. The gate that will forever be in our memory. Delta Flight 655, Departure time was set for 10:41 am on our boarding passes and once we arrived at gate E 14 at 10:28 am. Our flight was gone. Boarding had ended, and our fight had fully departed. My heart sank, we were in disbelief. Frantic, I ask the Delta representative at gate E 14 where our plane was and the gentlemen stated that the flight left at 10:26 am. My husband and I spoke with several representatives who were rude and unempathetic as they made things seems as though it was our fault that we were late. I was honestly unable to comprehend why our flight was gone and it was well before 10:41 am. Absolutely devastated, my questions meant nothing to anyone. There was even a gentleman who worked for Delta who felt it was appropriate to tell us that he called us on the intercom to board while we were on our way from our first flight because they knew we had checked in from our previous flight from STL. We were offered a complimentary flight for the next day only after we asked to speak to a supervisor. Defeated, we accepted with no choice. We asked for a complimentary room for Deltaâ€™s inconvenience and we were laughed at by the Supervisor. My husband and I spent the first day of our honeymoon in the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. (over 24 hours)  My husband and I had no luggage as we spent the night in an unknown State. We were responsible for late check in fees to our resort in Aruba.  We were charged cancellation fees for reservations made on our first day of arrival. We will never forget our horrific experience and never trust this airline again, regardless of cost."

On our way back, there was room in the back of first-class and he asked if we would like to move up as a ""wedding gift"" from him. That was super kind of him and we did not expect that nor did he need to. It was just such a kind gesture that we've never received before. Very pleasant gentleman, polite, and goes above and beyond the call of duty. We just wanted to let the company of Delta know that Ken is an excellent employee! "

When we were rebooked we were put at the very back of the plane. Our friends who purchased economy were put in the middle around row 19. The cancellation and not able to get out of NYC costed us an additional $900. Thankfully, we could afford to get rooms. Many couldn't. Delta did absolutely nothing to assist. I get weather causes delays and cancellations, but not for 2 days. When I contacted Delta, they offered $25 or 500 miles in the spirit of goodwill. I try to use Delta vs low cost carriers for better options when these things occur. Not anymore, there is no difference that I am able to see."

We were sent to a customer service area in the middle of the Gate E. I accidentally got in the Platinum line. I told her I was not Platinum but we just missed our flight. I wish I knew her name. She asked why we missed our flight. I said it was our fault and that we were stupid.

Delta does not allow you to sit standby if you buy their basic economy class. You have to pay for the more expensive tickets for this feature. This makes it difficult to flex with a military work schedule. So if you get off early and want to try and get on an earlier flight. Forget about it because Delta will not help you out.
1045,9,9,August,2019,Economy Class,Boston , Cancun , Atlanta      ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Detroit to St Louis. $75 to fly standby. That's all I need to say. Generally I really like Delta flights and how they are ran. But this is a serious customer service issue. Other airlines still allow you to fly standby on earlier flights for free. Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers. But, Delta decided to go to the dark side on this one, forgo good will to their customers and make that extra $75. I personally will make sure to fly United or Southwest in the future if I have the reasonable option. I'm not swearing off Delta entirely as I care for convenience in my travel first and foremost, but I do guarantee I will purchase at least a couple fewer Delta tickets this year. I suggest if you want the flexibility to fly standby without any extra charge, that you fly with a different airline as well."

Got delayed and cancelled on the Tarmac leaving SLC. Got lucky and had an available plane and reboarded within an hour and a half.

My 14 old brother was a part of mandatory UMNR program. The whole registration process was a mess. At first we were told by a registration agent that he wasn't registered for a program, when I insisted that he was as I wouldn't be able to purchase a ticket without registering him for a program, the agent was able to find a record. Without apologizing for the stress, he proceeded registering my brother and printed his boarding pass with the assigned seat that I requested 6 moths ago 40A (near the window). At the time of the boarding after standing in line we were told by the stewardess in a pretty rude tone that my brother will be boarding the last. We waited for an entire airplane to board and the stewardess finally nodded us that we can go ahead. She then printed additional slip and without showing it to me took my brother to board. When the plane took off, my brother texted me that he was seated to the seat #17 in between two other passengers and his requested and already assigned seat was given away to somebody else. Nobody told me that at the time I was passing my brother to the Delta Airline agent, and needless to say my brother who studies English as a second language wasn't able to raise a concern on his own. I felt helpless and very disappointed. The terrible service we received cost us $150 in addition to the plain ticket and caused the worst international travel experience. This complain was submitted at the airline website first to give them a chance to respond. After waiting for a month with no respond, I am re-posting here."
1048,1,9,August,2019,Economy Class,Atlanta , Stuttgart        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Portland to Washington. I hate that Iâ€™m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minorâ€™s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasnâ€™t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the â€œcontract I signedâ€. I informed them that I clearly havenâ€™t signed anything, because itâ€™s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didnâ€™t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without  tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didnâ€™t believe them but I wasnâ€™t going to waste time asking for management after the way Iâ€™d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said â€œyou need to stay backâ€ I just looked at her like â€œIâ€™m just trying to hug them goodbyeâ€ and even another mom came up to me and said â€œthey have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?â€ And if only she knew the half of it. Youâ€™d think this review stops here, but it doesnâ€™t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadnâ€™t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and weâ€™re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport. And THEN I find out that they in fact sent my kids suitcase to the wrong airport, and their dad had to drive to two different airports and pay $50 in parking. I will never fly Delta again, nor will I recommend them."

Our 45 minute flight was scheduled at no later than 11pm last night and now it is currently set to leave at noon today! Thatâ€™s only after buying new tickets, as our flight got cancelled after a 3 hour delay at the last minute. If youâ€™re in a rush to get home and want to end up frustrated because youâ€™re stuck in an airport, I highly recommend flying with Delta Airlines. Not only will they not compensate you, but they will also lose your luggage! But on the bright side, we did get free snacks. Why, I love a granola bar. So worth my 700$ ticket and my luggage. I really wish I could say this is the first time weâ€™ve had this issue, or the second time, or the third. Could be worse. At least Iâ€™m not on the 48 hour delay flights like most people around me.

Long version: I made a mistake while booking two-way flight tickets from Boston to Nashville. Travelling from Boston to Nashville did go well on August 5th. I booked my return flight for the very next day (August 6th) at least I thought that. However, I realized that I did book my return ticket for August 7th while checking in at Airport. I didn't know how to react (I was the victim for my mistake). Anyways, went to counter and the Delta person was really polite and nice. He asked for a moment to talk with someone behind the counter and he returned saying I am good to travel today (August 6th) for no more charges or anything. I was expecting for pay somewhere around $50 - $100 USD. But they were too good to forgive my mistake and now I am at the gates about to board the flight to Boston.

I asked the representative at the gate if she could change the seats & she stated ""Ma'am this flight is completely booked so you'll have to figure it out when you get on the plane."" I stood there for a moment & I asked her if there were any other options & she said yes you have the option to figure it out yourself.

Understandably, we were delayed from a 9:25pm flight due to bad weather (thunderstorms, rain, etc), and they had to search for a new route to take. This took 3.5 hours, which I guess is justifiable when looking for a safe route. HOWEVER, for some reason we had to make a stop in Minnesota for a pilot change. The flight crew assured us that a new one would be waiting at the airport so itâ€™d be a quick stop so we can get back on our way. Sure why not, maybe the pilot was supposed to be off around our original departure time. BUT, it takes 2.5 hours to get from New York to Minnesota and on top of the 3.5 hour original delay, they had 6 hours to find a new pilot. Guess what? When we arrived at the airport there was no pilot available. They told us itâ€™d be another 3 hour delay annoying literally everyone on board because they couldnâ€™t find another pilot to take over. It was 3am when we arrived, so we leave again at 6am. Well guess what, 2 hours into the wait they said itâ€™s likely going to be an extra 1.75 hours (departure now 7:45am) because they STILL couldnâ€™t find another damn pilot to fly the stupid plane. This comes to a total of around 8 hours of flight delays with half of the time not being due to weather anymore, but incompetence. Itâ€™s 5am as I write this (they just made the extended delay announcement), and Iâ€™m hoping it doesnâ€™t extend again cause this is ridiculous. Will never fly with again."

However, my family and I chose Delta for our flight to Germany as the prices were much cheaper than Southwest. Upon arrival to Midway on a Monday morning, we stood in line for 30-45 minutes just to check our bags because they only had 1 person working. this person completely ignored the long line of non-sky miles passengers, including a disabled man who was struggling to stand for the long wait period. Fast forwarding to our flight, we were delayed 3 separate times (at the fault of weather, not Delta). However, we had to reschedule our flight to depart from O'Hare due to an insufficient layover time. We proceeded to Midway Delta baggage claim office and found that the door was locked and the office left empty. We asked the Delta office next door for assistance and they rudely told us to return exactly where we came from.

The problem was that when I called them the same night they said they had nothing but they would call me back, two weeks later passed they still hadn't call me and every single time I called I was told ""we will call you back"". I called them back almost every single day, every single time it was a different story and when finally someone told me that in fact those bottles where there, the next day they would say they had nothing. I don't understand how those bottles be there one day and then be gone the next day. As much as I like Delta I have to say that they or whoever opened my suitcases broke the rules because by law they are supposed to open my suitcases in front of me, they are supposed to call me to let me know that they are going to open them and none of that happened. Its over a month now and I've only gotten 7 of my bottles after they said they had 8. I no longer know what to do. I call Delta I call the TSA and all they say is that they only have 7 when I know for a fact that they have the remaining bottles."

Iâ€™m extremely disappointed in the quality of service of Delta. I had a one hour flight home from L.A. to Phoenix and about an hour before take off, I received a notification that the gate has changed and the time of departure has been delayed 5 hours (which would get me home by 1am - originally would have landed at 8pm). I spoke to 3 customer service reps, 2 by phone and 1 at the airport, and none were helpful in getting me on a new flight. What frustrated me most is they didnâ€™t even try and offered me a $25 meal voucher. Keep in mind the terminal has about 2 food options, both of which are terrible, so I declined the voucher. I could have driven home sooner than the new arrival time, but because they notified us about the delay an hour before take off, it was too late to leave the airport, shuttle to the car rental, and drive home (leaving this airport is a nightmare). I am beyond unhappy with Delta and do not recommend this airline."

No problem, they let me reschedule for free even though I had an extra 3 more hours to spend in flight time which would have resulted in a cheaper flight from the start. New flight has me going through Atlanta where my connecting flight is delayed 3 hours because the original aircraft scheduled to Toronto was changed to Memphis 30 minutes before boarding time. I may just be upset in the moment, or it could be that anytime I fly with Delta there is always a delay somewhere. The aircraft and staff are usually friendly, this is more directed to overall operations of the airline."

Then they damaged my suite case twice and filled out a complain paper and they told me they canâ€™t help me!? The same with something I forgot in the plane. They even didnâ€™t wanted to help me. They have the worst costumer services I called them 2 hours later they called me back and I tried to talk very nice but after 10 minutes they just hang up!

First, I had my flight to Chicago delayed because of a problem with a crew member, and then the flight eventually got canceled because of a rain. When I asked for a reimbursement, they denied because the flight is canceled due to weather. I didnâ€™t get any refund for a bus ticket I already paid for in Chicago, or a place to stay. They gave me another flight to Chicago that stops in Atlanta, which is also delayed, and so was my flight from Atlanta to Chicago. Because of Deltaâ€™s inability to schedule flights correctly, I missed a bus that I paid 40 dollars for. I also had to wait 3 hours in Chicago because they left my bag in Atlanta for whatever reason.

I was scheduled to fly to New York on the 17th at 11:30 am. That flight got delayed until 12:30, we then proceeded to board yet we sat on the runway for over an hour because of weather conditions. We then were told to deboard but stay close because we will take off soon. This never happened, they then canceled the flight and scheduled another one for later, that got canceled and then told us to wait for another flight at 1:30 am. We waited 15 mins before boarding and they proceeded to cancel it yet again. That means my family, along with everyone else had to sleep in the airport. There were cots lined up for miles, but we had to get up at 4 am to put them away. My flight now today was supposed to leave at 6 this morning. Itâ€™s now 6:10 and itâ€™s delayed yet again because apparently they prioritize flights from today over flights that shouldâ€™ve left yesterday. They are terrible at communicating and weâ€™ve had to switch gates numerous times, itâ€™s ridiculous. I would never recommend this airline upon anyone, they just take your money and run."

They then scheduled us for 3 more flights which they canceled with terrible communication. The communication was horrible, nobody knew what was happening until a few minutes before boarding.

I am writing only because of the appalling customer service I recently received. I know the flights are full and tensions are high however Delta puts it head and the ground and ignores it. We were on a flight from Asheville to Bonaire via Atlanta. The flight from Asheville had a small mechanical problem. It took the mechanic less than a minute to fix, however it took the mechanic 1.5 hours to get to the airport. Really? So we, four of us, missed our flight to Bonaire. This was at 9am and we are in Atlanta now for a full 24 hours - they would not put us on another flight. We go to the customer service desk and give us voucher to a motel that their employees do not even stay in. We asked for another option, with a restaurant and they said they do not give hotel vouchers to hotels with restaurants. No food vouchers, no transportation, nothing. We asked to talk to a manager and they gave us a number that is only answered Monday through Friday 9 to 5pm. It is a Saturday and we are flying out of the country. We have a water front condo with two bedrooms and a car rental that we lost out on. The next day we have to check our bags in all over again. My husband and I wait in line to check our bags in. We had picked them up the day before so we could have our things. After 25 minutes to do this, we are told we have to go into another line b/c there is no record we had paid for a bag the day before to Bonaire. There was another 20 to 30 minute line. I asked if she could take us to the front of the line and she said no. My husband nearly had a melt down. He gave me the dressing down and she felt so badly she took us over and checked us in. NOW WHY COULD SHE NOT DO THAT TO BEGIN WITH. I felt like they were trying to make us late and we would miss our flight again."

Iâ€™ve always supported this airline, I have for years, but from now on Iâ€™m taking my business elsewhere. Completely unhelpful, every single employee was rude and short with me. Not only with me but with everyone else as well. Flying out of Orlando can be hard I understand that but thatâ€™s no excuse to treat people disrespectfully. Also everyone on the plane is paying an arm and a leg to where they need to be. "
1079,1,7,July,2019,Economy Class,Peoria , Atlanta        , Daytona      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today. As someone who travels every year, I will do my best to ensure that those whom I know don't travel with Delta and that I don't take a flight associated with Delta again."

On our ride to Orlando from LaGuardia we had a nine hour layover due to the incompetence of the Delta staff. After our original flight was delayed and we missed our connection we were put on the waiting list first. They told us there was no room for us and proceeded to board the people after us on the list. When we got to Orlando Delta lost one of our fellow passengers luggage and said â€œwhoops weâ€™ll see if we can send it to your house laterâ€, the lady whose luggage was lost was in tears and the Deltas employees flippant attitude made it worse. Delta had to cancel a flight to Georgia due to the weather in LaGuardia even though other flights were still taking off. Because they blaimed weather that affected no other flights the people whose flights were cancelled were not compensated. The gate changes are almost impossible to keep up with too. As I write this horrible review I am waiting for a flight that has yet again been delayed last minute. I lost a day at Disney due to Deltas incompetence. Here is my parting advice Delta does not care about you they just want your money they will lie to you and cheat you and swindle you because in the end they know youâ€™ll come back if the flights are cheap enough. Its an air plane menopoly and they will never ever be honest with you. The only minor source of joy is a small TV with no volume."

Boston to Atlanta on Wednesday, June 12, 2019 leaving Boston at 6:24 pm and scheduled to arrive at 9:20 pm. The connecting flight was Atlanta to Tulsa (where I live) scheduled to depart at 10:08 pm. The flight from Boston was a little delayed and landed at 10:32 but taxied another seven minutes. We knew our connection was tight but no flight attendants helped. It used to be that they would announce close connections, allow those people to get off first. Not here. We were at the back of the plane and didn't de-board until 10:44. We had twenty-four min to make our connection in another part of airport. I asked gate attendant to call ahead and let them know we were coming. He shook his head no and we started at a dead run. Me and family (four of us) We made it there at 10:58. The gate was closed. They closed a full 15 min early, knowing they had a close-connecting flight. A couple there who were in the front of our plane arrived two min earlier than we did. The gate was not closed because it's ""regulation"" to close 15 min prior to take off. It closed 15 mins prior to take-off to board their standby employees. That's what I was later told. I would like proof of this but don't have it. Delta has it. The next morning June 13 we took a flight (DL3467) to Tulsa departing at 8:25. It closed its gate at 8:21. Four minutes prior to take-off. So it is not a regulation. Six people I know of missed the flight the night before because Delta breached our contract and inflicted emotional distress in order to further their own causes by boarding their own people. When we went to customer service that night, they refused to pay for the hotel because the plane was ""not that late."" They blamed us for missing the flight. I told them that was unacceptable and they finally made a call and okayed ours and everyone's overnight stay (found this out later on bus to hotel). A side note: on June 7 fight DL1846 leaving Tulsa at 6:42 to Atlanta then Boston we also missed the connecting flight in Atlanta due to mechanical issues which I understand. But we spent the night sleeping on airport chairs. No apologies, no offer of pillows, no offer of blankets, etc. Delta is unfriendly and does not care about its customers. Once they take your money, they don't care. I answered their survey re these flights and asked for a manager at Delta to call me. I've heard nothing."

We kept being told by Delta that this was impossible and they do not know how it happened. We were flying down to Miami for a cruise that left the next day. We went to the Delta lost luggage counter when we arrived in Miami and were told my bag was re tagged and would arrive to us by 11pm that night at our hotel. I woke up at 9am the next day and no bag had been delivered. We were boarding our cruise boat at 2pm and i had no belongings. The bag arrived 30 minutes later but it was not my bag. It is assumed that this was the bag of the man which my bag was mistagged under. It was easter so we could not even go to a clothing store to get any clothes since everything was closed . Our two vacation days in Miami prior to the cruise were ruined. We had to waste time at the bag counter and stop at stores to get belongings instead of enjoying our trip. We spent the two days on and off the phone with Delta. Luckily the bag arrived right before the cruise boat left. They did reimburse us for belongings we had to buy prior to getting on the boat which is appreciated, but does not fix the fact that they ruined part of my trip. I feel that mistagging my bag with a different persons name is a huge mistake. If that guy or someone else took my bag I would have never seen it again. I emailed Delta to speak with them about the matter twice and they have not even acknowledged my email."
1088,1,26,June,2019,Premium Economy,"Tampa, FL ", New York      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do.  After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome. Because Delta is not affiliated with Norwegian , they could not help me rebook my international flight and I lost my money on the ticket, a day of my vacation, and multiple tours and bookings due to multiple issues on Delta's part. I am disgusted by the lack of customer service."

I paid for Comfort+ seat which includes extra legroom and dedicated overhead bin space. My connecting flight (DL140 to Brussels) said that I have to check my carry-on baggage because the flight is too full. I am very upset that Delta would put other personal luggage in my overhead bin that I paid for. Then force me to check my baggage. It was such an inconvenience to take out my work and personal laptop.The staff members were very unprofessional and discriminated against me because of my skin color. I never like flying from New York, but I had no choice. I will never fly out New York again. Flying from Atlanta is more convenient and the Delta Staff members are friendly.

The last of the great the three great American airlines I fly with. Boarding was a mess: there were so many different classes, it gets confusing. Also, people are called out for a boarding class that does not match what is written on the boarding pass (e. g. ""basic"" can be ""main""). And with two flights boarding at very close times, in such a tiny space, it got very confused to know who was being called for boarding, as the staff kept on talking one after the other (in Montreal) or kept on passing information one over the other (in Minneapolis). Some seats are assigned at the boarding stage. Had never seen this one and it seems an extra unnecessary step. Service on board could see some more smiling and some less mobile fun by some of the staff, in some cases."

The lady at the desk rescheduled our flight. Needless to say she messed up our connection flights. Luckily we caught her mistake and we attempted to fix it. It took a half hour of bantering with another Delta employee before we finally correctly rescheduled our flight. We spent 7 hours waiting for that flight. We were not compensated and I was left feeling like Delta did not care about me or any of my fellow passengers. I missed a day at Disney our vacation destination.

On the first leg of the flight, Delta did not have any bassinets so the baby sat on my knee for 7 hours. On the second leg, we were told we would have one bassinet. We did not. They told us we would have a spare seat at least. We did not. An upset family took the spare seat after they too had been screwed around by Delta. Staff admitted that we had been lied to on several occasions. All staff, bar one, were rude and just couldn't care. Delta just don't care. After 23 hours with a baby on my lap, no sleep and terrible food - I promised I would do something to balance the world back out by leaving this review and telling people to pay the extra $30 to go with a proper airline.

I was then provided a number to call and the person I spoke with, told me they can't do anything and I would have to talk to the agents at the airport which is odd because the agent told me to call you. Now time to board , I'm told they have to check in my carry on (my bag was already gone because they wouldn't take it) and I told them I don't feel comfortable checking in my carry on because I had things stolen before and I have my laptop and they replied ""you don't want to check it, you won't board""."

Missed connecting flight to MSY. It was the last flight of the night, so I wandered around ATL airport overnight until the first flight of the morning to MSY the next day. On the return, flight from ATL to EWR was delayed by about an hour, not too bad, but still a bit inconvenient. Ground staff in EWR and MSY were friendly, not so much in ATL. Cabin crew on 3 of the 4 flights were lovely. Tasty snacks and drinks included in the ticket. I wouldn't recommend Delta, they don't seem to have much respect for the passenger's time."

Got to the gate at 7:35. All the arrival/departure gate screens were not working or off. They had moved our flight to the other side of the airport with no warning. They made no announcements, and the lady that was making announcements at that gate spoke only broken English. Got a new flight booked for 12:50. So after sitting in the airport terminal for almost five hours, the dirtiest, most haggard airplane I've ever seen shows up at the terminal. We board and the captain comes over the intercom. He warns us that the APU is not working properly, and they cannot put cold air into the cabin, or start the main engines. We wait for a start cart. After cooking in the plane for half an hour while they wait, they tell us to go back to the terminal. If I had known I was going to go through this, I would have drove. I would have been there already. Now I'm sitting in the terminal still."

My daughter was to get a flight to London at 5:44pm and missed the luggage cut off time and she couldn't board. I called a number that i thought was Delta and they upcharged me $538 and told me she would be on the 7 pm flight guaranteed and needed to process it quickly as we had 15 min for her to board, me frantic paid for it to get her on which didn't happen. So here is my daughter a mess at the airport no flight. I contacted several people at Delta whom were all pleasant to speak with and trying to be very helpful the whole process. After being on hold and different people it was now 11 pm and couldn't do anything more. Next morning 6:30 Am called and spoke with a Jack in Dallas, who took the situation and quickly helped me place my daughter on the next direct flight to London. No up charge and excellent service. I cannot express how much his professional Customer Service Helped me! Thank you Delta, keep Good People like you have!!!"

My husband is on Kidney dialysis and we must travel with a portable dialysis machine which cannot be checked in it must be checked and hate to stay with him at all times. We label the machine in lime green duct tape with large letters stating itâ€™s a medical device. This machine was pink tagged by Delta as well meaning it cannot go on a luggage carousel. We traveled from Atlanta to Puerto Rico on June 7th. When we landed our machine was not waiting on us to deboard the flight. We were told that the device had been thrown into the carousel. This is a $4000 machine and a life or death device for my husband and they overlooked the markings and tags and just threw on the carousel. They did realize their mistake and radioed the luggage department. However they did not advise us of any of this. We spent 20 minutes looking for the machine on the carousel. I finally decided to look for someone and found the luggage office. Our device was in the office!! This special $500 car that transports it was damaged luckily the machine was not. When a complaint was made the pulled the pink tagged marked by Delta it was under the wrong name!! Had this luggage been lost we would have never been able to get it back. What really saddens us is no one seemed to care! Youâ€™re supposed to be the friendly sky! Shame on you Delta! Educate your employees!

Well the return flight was awesome. Flight Attendant went out of her way to keep checking up on me during the flight even though she didn't have to. Also I finally got to have the Delta signature Cocktail as the flight attendant knew how to make it. She even went out of her way to make it from scratch and not pouring it out of the pre made bottle that is loaded from the catering kitchen. The cocktail was refeshing, and the meal service was good as well. Everything is was the usual Delta service for transatlantic service. Overall a great experience and flight back home after a good vacation."

The usual service which was good in Business class meals and service prompt. However the drink service was awful because the flight attendant working my side of the plane did not know how to make drinks and she even mentioned she did not drink so did not know how much of what gets mixed. I was shocked as frequent flyer who travels Business Class for international travel with a variety of airlines. At this point I am wondering how Delta allowed this person to pass the needed classes and training given. She did not know how to make Delta's signature cocktail which is highlighted in the menu card given. So much for the cocktail that Delta raves about. I ended up having to take a coke zero twice. Fastforward to morning time about six hours later before landing at AMS. The same person is working my side this time she walks by for breakfast I ask for Coffee and she has to move the cart as to others wanting to use the bathroom and then totally forgets to serve us breakfast. I even brought it to her attention but she did not care. ThankfulIy I was not hungry. If anyone from Delta actually reads this make sure your cabin crew is fully trained for International flights more so for Business class service.

We were told a new flight would arrive at 7.15 pm that got pushed to 9.56 pm then cancelled altogether. Rebooked for 6.20 am today and I wasnâ€™t able to check in online, was not told the slip I was given wasnâ€™t a boarding pass so by the time I went through TSA and was told to go downstairs, I was too late to checkin. The self service machine upstairs was broken. Staff showed zero empathy and made no effort to help. The employee took immense pleasure in calling the supervisor asking if I could late check in but failing to mention everything that happened to me yesterday, framing it so it sounded like it was completely my fault. I have clinically bad anxiety and now I am traumatized from this experience."

Because of bad reviews I was a bid worried about my flight with Delta. But in the end it was a nice and enjoyable flight. The check in and the transfer in Atlanta worked out fine. I was a bit surprise how long the boarding takes, because of all the small groups being called to get to the gate. That explains why I have to be at the gate so early. But how cares as long as it works. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful. It was a lot of fun to chat with them. They were great and very professional. Although we should not forget that they are on the flight for safety reasons and not only as waitresses and waiters. But I have my doubts that the age group of flight attendants during my flight is still able to do that. One flight attendant stumbled twice over a slight step on the floor. After so many years that should not happen any more. To make sure, it is not about youth and beauty, this is about safety. The service was excellent the food was fine and nothing to complain. The WiFi during the flight just for messages was amazing. I spend a lot of time by sending messages around the world. The seat was really old and not very comfortable. The length is okay but the width did not work at all. I was sorry that the new seats were not available. A big plus for me was the matter that my luggage could get through to Mexico. It is always a horror to pick up the luggage and drop it of again 5 seconds later. Finally it was a nice and smooth flight and if I have to fly with Delta again I will look forward to it."

Worst part? We have our infant with us. We arrived at the Ft. Meyers airport 2 hours early as expected and found that our 6pm flight had been delayed multiple times. Once we got through the sea of people waiting for rebookings Delta told us to take a 10p flight to ATL and they would provide a hotel voucher when we landed so we had a place to stay until our 7am. We landed at midnight, grabbed our checked luggage and looked for the Delta desk to receive such voucher only to find a 2 hour line in front of us. Three associates working and all their monitors turned off. Word spread through the line that there were no hotel vouchers to be given and that multiple new flights were delayed. Completely baffled, concerned and infuriated my husband waited in the two hour line to check our suitcases and to figure out our next step. Suddenly as he approached the desk 2 hours later they announced that they were not accepting any more checked bags until 4:30am. We wasted 2 hours in this line for absolutely nothing. They didn't offer us anything and said that there was nothing for us to do so we are sitting in the middle of the ATL airport with an infant, stroller, carseat, and two suitcases due to no communication, no organization, and ""customer service"" built on lies."

The plane weâ€™ve needed to take has been parked in the terminal since weâ€™ve gotten here the reason we havenâ€™t left yet is because are pilot isnâ€™t here yet.

This is the third consecutive Delta flight where we were delayed. This time was particularly egregious. Morning of, flight was delayed from 8 to 12. Not ideal, but at least we knew the night before. Then, 1o minutes before boarding, flight is delayed another 4 hours! And then there was not contextual information given about what was the issue or when it would be resolved, only that they were â€œworking on a replacement crewâ€. We missed an important family event (graduation) but also wasted a day in the airport waiting (we could have been working or spending time with our kids!). Then, when I call customer service, they offer us a $25 voucher! Thatâ€™s just a complete insult. I would rather spend the next 5 hours in the airport writing negative reviews than accept $25. I will never be using Delta again and recommending all my family (delta users) switch airlines to a company that knows basic customer service."

However when I asked why I wasnâ€™t notified and if you get a voucher they kept on sending me to another desk. First they blamed KLM as they are partnering. However it was their website I had to use to check in. I queued up for 3 times and constantly hearing I was not at the right location. In the end they send me to the gate. But of course no one was there as it was 4hrs for departure. Nicely done Delta, just guide your passengers to another desk until there is no one left to ask what happened or in the end complain to. I would train your ground staff differently."

At 11am, we are then notified that we will not be boarding again till 12:30pm. Shortly after that, someone came on the intercom to inform us that the â€œpilotâ€ was stuck in South Carolina and would not be in till 1:15pm. Which doesnâ€™t seem to make any sense.

Gate attendant in Atlanta on the outbound leg was particularly nice and helpful to those flying with young children. Snacks and drinks in all cabins and lunch on the mid-day flight from St. Martin in First Class. Everything went smoothly. Quite a bit of turbulence out of St. Martin but the pilot had provided some advance info and kept passengers informed so not really stressful. Check-in at St. Martin took longer than anticipated as there are no kiosks set up (and the airport still shows signs of hurricane damage) so had a queue to contend with but was still handled well."

Now our boarding â€œpromised timeâ€ is 12:30 AM. Weâ€™ve tried talking to the attendants and they were all rude granted none of them could give us a straight answer.

When I returned for additional assistance, I was treated with hostility and when I expressed that I had health problems and could not go on any more wild goose chases in the airport and needed their assistance they threatened to call a paramedic. This was not out of concern but expressed rudely basically saying if you donâ€™t shut up we will call a paramedic to come get you. I was clearly frustrated but I was not yelling or cussing as other customers were. I just needed help with locating my bag. I was so shocked and appalled by how I was treated by Delta."

They gave me a tracking number to track the luggage but after 3 weeks that the luggage did not show up, I called them and they told me that the luggage was missing. I filled claims which they refused to pay and referred me to UPS and UPS told that I should call Delta. After series of calls , Delta blocked my line and I couldnâ€™t reach them anymore and after 5 months I still have not received my luggage.

However I have only flown with Delta a handful of times, and 2 out of the 3 or 4 times they lost my luggage by trying to check my carry on at the gate. I flew from Texas for my grandmother 75th surprise birthday party, but my luggage is in ATL. This is completely irresponsible and now I have nothing. Once I got to Atlanta they said my luggage was in baggage claim but it was suppose to follow me to Baltimore. Now I see why others were reluctant to check their carry ons at the gate. Customer service promised this would be resolved and my luggage would meet me in Baltimore after she ""rechecked it"". I'm not sure what that means but she was trying to help. I've called customer service this morning for an update on my luggage but I was on hold, and then got hung up on so now I'm on hold for another 18 mins and my grandmother's event starts in 4 hours. Not to mention that when I asked for a supervisor the woman said she was a manager and hung up on me. I have to rebuy everything! I dont even have a toothbrush or underwear for I dont know how long. I go back to Texas tomorrow and my baggage is in ATL. I regret buying this flight because I'm now a sitting duck with nothing.

I missed my connection flight due to â€œweatherâ€ which they used as an excuse to not pay for a hotel room.

On 21 May 2019 I traveled from Lisbon to Indianapolis via JFK and returned to Lisbon via Boston on May 28, 2019. On four flights there were 3 delays all for technical and mechanical reasons, which leaves me worried about the quality and maintenance of yours aircrafts One of the delays was more than three hours almost compromising the connecting flight to Lisbon and at this moment I am in Boston waiting to board again for mechanical reasons without being served a simple bottle of water. The flight at this time is already delayed 30 minutes and is expected to depart more than one hour late. Inadmissible, mainly because it is happening for the third time in three consecutive flights and in the same airline. Added to this is the fact that I have always been allocated seats in the tail of the planes on all flights when I requested an upgrade when booking and upon check-in. As a result of the assigned places I was left with no menu option once the option of meat was finished at lunch on the first intercontinental flight and on another flight, that of the three-hour delay, due to the host's incompetence, we were not served the drink at that we were entitled and for which we paid for ""lack of time""  Let's see what reserves this flight ... I must also express my displeasure at the approach of your collaborators at Lisbon Airport prior to check-in. I have often traveled to the USA on other airlines and such approach has never been done. Even a sticker put in the passport what is illegal when done by people without the authority to do so. I thought it was abusive. I also hate your way of managing boarding on the planes that I consider very complicated. The competitive rates do not compensate for the poor service provided, the lack of care and consideration for the passengers you sit in the last places of the plane."

The first class section was actually pathetic. The amount of personal space and legroom was absolutely minimum.The attendants were incredible and offered great but unnecessarily rushed service for a 6 hour flight. They are the reason, the only reason to pay for a first class ticket and sit in a cattle car. The row ahead of me erupted into a screaming match because one of the party lost it when the guy in front reclined and she could no longer see her screen.

They even dropped his seat on his next flight as he was standing in front of them. His next flight was delayed 15 minutes so then he had to sit and watch his next flight standstill while he was treated with disrespect by the most unhelpful and rude people at the Delta terminal. And the best part? They offered him a discounted hotel (not even a free hotel stay!), no food, and no vouchers! I also called ATL to get in touch with a Delta representative and not only did they have me wait 2x longer on hold on the phone just to reach a representative, but finally once I was able to speak with a representative they said ""hmm that's strange, looks like his first flight landed 30 minutes before his next flight was scheduled to depart and his second flight was delayed 15 minutes so he had time.""

When we as individuals can see online there are seats available, however the airline tells us nothing is available for 3 days. Horrible service. Always getting pushed to someone else's problem."

We stupidly missed our connecting flight with Mongolian Airlines from Seoul To Mongolia because we got confused with the local timezone and arrived at our gate 30 minutes after takeoff. We called up Delta Airlines and they were fantastic, they arranged for us to be on the next available flight at no cost to us. One of their representatives guided us to our new terminal and our luggage was found and re-directed to our new flight without any difficulties. Delta Airlines saved our trip from being a complete disaster and we are incredibly thankful for that."

However, they damaged two of my bags. We didn't plan on checking the carry-ons but did so because the flight was full. But instead of getting the bags at the ramp on the next stop, the carry-ons went all the way to our destination. We were not informed that these were going all the way to our destination when we checked them at the gate, and they weren't locked. When we picked them up, one of the bags had the front pocket zippers completely ripped off so there is now no way to close the front pocket, and the other carry on had tire tread marks all over it. On the way back, the large suitcase I checked was split open on one corner. It looked like they just threw the bag which landed on the corner and caused it to split. The large bag was only a year old and used only one time. The carry-ons were brand new. They were not overstuffed so the only way they could have been damaged is by mishandling by the baggage crew. I didn't know the procedure for filing a claim for the bags the night we discovered the damage and I didn't show the bags to Delta when I was at the airport, so I am now not able to file a claim to get a reimbursement. Delta really has no respect for your personal property."

On time departures and arrivals on this trip. Courteous in-flight crew. Clean aircraft. Pilots made timely announcements. Seats were a tad tight but entirely passable as was leg space - I had aisle seats. On the DTW-LGA route, the Airbus 320 had individual entertainment screens which in addition to a good selection of movies, TV shows, and music, also had a large variety of games (including chess). Head phones have to be bought for two dollars with a credit card. The screen also showed the flight path. In-flight service included, in addition to a variety of complimentary non-alcoholic beverages, a choice of snacks - cookies or Cheezit. Disembarking at the gates was quick. While changing at Detroit, I was very worried that I would miss the connection as I arrived at gate 2 in Terminal B and had to go to gate 75 in Terminal A. This would be among the longest of distances between two gates and I had only 37 minutes! My concerns were misplaced. I made it in good time. The flight between South Bend and Detroit does not offer any beverage service. Boarding on both flights went smoothly but with so many categories of passengers, airlines have finessed the system to a new high - and they implement it well! The disembarkation is less discriminatory - they start with the lowest numbered rows and go up. My recent travels with Delta have all been positive and the in-flight ambiance is pleasant and comfortable. Keep up the good work, Delta!"

Every staff member we have interacted with today has a curt, rude attitude. Delta seems to have a negative company culture. Not only have they been rude to us but they are rude and unkind to each other. My husband was not given a seat assignment even though we checked in at the same time. At the gate he asked for a seat, but the staff were discourteous and bickering in front of him. ."

I have purchased first class ticket on DL and paid fortune for it. In addition to that, DL charges $125 for pet in a cabin, which I happily paid. I took our small bird with us. Check-in staff was nice but flight attendant was worst possible, night mear that you cannot even imagine about. I was in a seat 3A, first thing she mention to other passenger next to me was â€œI have seen it all, but in 40 years I never experienced bird in a cabinâ€ She was so nasty and so awful. She than asked what we wish to drink. I kindly ordered orange juice. Lady next to me got her water and my juice never arrived. Instead i got nasty looks every time she passed by. She was giving me terrible looks and passed by. Perhaps she hated guys with pets and hates everyone who is not up to her likings. She made sure I comply with a rule and place the bird under the seat, which is fine. She could at least be kind. I have never seen so much nastiness towards first class passengers We are returning to NY next week and will never fly Delta again. Congrats for hating your passengers Delta and well done on training your crew so well."

When she finished informing me that I would not be able to fly without my pet due to extreme heat temperatures, I asked her when the next flight would be and she got extremely confrontational and asked me why I was interrupting her. I was so shocked I said, ""please finish,"" and she got an even worse attitude with me. I fully understand the flight regulations on pets with temperatures above 80F and simply asked when the next flight would be. I am active military and honestly would never select to fly with Delta again if it weren't for them accommodating military with pets. It's a shame their workers have such an attitude when asked simple questions."

I spent $60 to check in a bag smaller than most others carry-ons. Other people have two to three carry-ons that they are allowed to check at the gate and have waiting for them when they got off the plane for no charge. This was ridiculous, for this reason I will never fly Delta again."
1141,1,13,May,2019,First Class,Seattle , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  Our travels via Delta were very unsatisfactory - said we were too late to check luggage (unpublicized baggage check cut off), missed first leg. Then wouldn't give us the credit card free bag deal, but the kicker was that when I flew (separately) from Atlanta to Boston on a cheap seat, I knew I would be at the end of the line. OK. Got a seat assignment - surely middle - but as I was to board the gate person said 'wait, your seat has been changed' and gave me a piece of paper with the new seat. No big deal I thought. Went to rear of plane and had trouble finding my seat-window seat - a 300 lb woman was in the middle seat! I managed to get into my mouse trap seat, she was friendly, I was OK, but later I realized that my middle seat a few rows ahead had been taken-likely a window person decided not to be shoe horned into 'my seat' and sit next to this woman (she was a nice person and clearly knew she was a 'customer of size' but I didn't see any point of being unpleasant). But that Delta would regard me of having no merit-that they'd seize my seat for another 'higher ranking customer' is beyond belief. It was only a 2 hour flight to Boston but I would likely have had to wet my pants if I needed to get to the restroom-so impossible was it to get out of my mouse trap. I will never fly Delta again. First choice: Southwest, second Air Alaska, third Jet Blue. Legacy airlines like Delta and United are terrible today. Avoid them."

Delta used to be good but their service has completely deteriorated. Delays, delays, delays is all I have to say. Choose another airline. I'm strongly considering cancelling my credit card with them and moving to another more dependable airline. If I could give 0, I certainly would. And to add injury to insult they tried to upgrade me to first class on a Republic Airlines flight."

Both of my flights were late going to and from my destinations, I almost missed my connecting flight. The seats are to small (while leg room is sufficient) the actual seat does not comfortably fit someone with adult hips. The wifi does not work on the plane, even after we are at 10,000 feet. The staff is rude,  I understand that this job is stressful, but customer service requires a smile, a hello, and how may I help you. Not eye rolls and dismissive comments. Lastly, on every Delta flight I have ever been on they ask us to check bags, even though my bag is small enough to fit on the overhead. I understand it's to speed up the process, but Delta, you need to find another way because that is very inconvenient. I do not want to wait at baggage claim if I made the effort to pack light. We pay way to much for these tickets for this poor level of service."

When I received the email I saw that wasnâ€™t the check in bag, I call back to make sure and they told me no its not showing but itâ€™s included, and I ask for email confirmation. When I went in the airport with my son they told me no itâ€™s not included, I paid $60 so my son can go in the flight and to travel, when I call they was tranfering me always, I was 45 minutes on the line, when my son went in Greece the bag wasnâ€™t in the airplane, they said itâ€™s Air France fault, they left in France, after 12 hours when he went to pick up the bag the bag was on delta flight.

Super unprofessional, unbothered and nonchalant. We missed our international flights and little to nothing was done to ensure we were in good hands. Called the 855 number and the agents seemed to be in a rush to book us in whatever flight they could find, no seat number, no idea where our checked bags were as the â€œtrack my bagsâ€ section in the app doesnâ€™t work. This was my first time flying Delta and I am never doing it again. Iâ€™m super, super mad!"
1146,2,11,May,2019,First Class,Baltimore , Boston        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked a trip on Delta traveling from Atlanta to Milan via New York for a 9 day back country ski trip in the alps. The flight from ATL to NY was delayed over 2 hours leaving only 1 hour after landing in NY until the flight to Milan was taking off. I had 2 bags; one for skis and one for clothes and equipment. The skis made it onto the flight to Milan. The other bag did not. After arriving in Milan I was assured that the bag would arrive the next day and would be delivered to my hotel that was several hours away in the alps. The bag did arrive the next day to Milan, but it ended up held up in the airport for 3 days because the baggage company only delivers on Wednesday. By Wed, our group had moved to another country and needed the bag delivered to the new country. Trying to arrange for that with Delta was a complete waste of time after spending numerous hours on the phone with them. They never connected my bag to me for the entire 9 days that I was away. They ultimately delivered it to the wrong country. I had to track it down and pay someone to deliver it back to the airport at the end of the trip so that I would be reconnected with my clothes and equipment to go back home with me. I heard a lot of lip service from Delta about how much they valued my platinum medallion status , but it was all lip service and no action on their part. Delta was worthless in making any effort to connect me to my bag, and equipment that I needed for backcountry skiing. Additionally worthless was their compensation, or lack thereof, for making me go 9 days without the clothes and equipment that I needed. If you really need something for your trip I recommend contracting with a 3rd party delivery service company to get your stuff overseas, because you can't count on Delta at all. What a horrible experience. I have booked flights on Delta before when I could have paid less to fly their partners overseas. From now on, I'll be booking those flights with their partners instead and saving money since Delta showed my no loyalty nor benefit to book with Delta instead. I was flying exclusively with Delta. Now, I'm a free agent. Loyalty needs to work both ways, and did not for that trip. My trip ended up miserable due to Delta. too much time on the phones - accomplishing nothing, and very uncomfortable trying to do things with clothes and equipment that were not right nor meant for the experience, since everything else was stuck in never land in my bag."

The flight from Seattle ran a bit late for the connecting flight however I made it in time to the gate. Delta basically just bumped me to a much later flight.

1149,3,9,May,2019,Economy Class,Tokyo , Singapore        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," Where do I start? We started our journey from Florida and had a delay due to a storm warning. Typical I hear for Florida which is out of the airlines control I understand. That's where the understanding ends. Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is. Oh just to add, my flight home now my wife and I are in non connecting seats and the gate customer service couldn't ""print tickets"" so I had to write down all the information on our receipts from the previous night, she didn't even have the courtesy to do that for me."

My flight was delayed, causing me to miss my connection flight by three minutes. My connection flight must have pushed back early because 3 minutes after the time of the flight the plane had already taken off, and failed to wait at all. I was comped a voucher for up to 15$ for food while I had to wait over four hours in the airport for the next flight. This is unacceptable for this kind of treatment, and I will be highly discouraging others from traveling delta in the future. With over 16 hours of total travel time and incredibly poor service on the airline, I am incredibly disappointed."

I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight. When I went to check in my luggage, a service which cost me $120, I was told that the flight had been canceled and that they would have to reroute me to my destination. This process took them 2 hours. Given their delay and incompetence, I missed that flight and had to go back to the check-in counter. I was told that they couldn't get me on another flight until the next day. I was forced to find a hotel and pay for it on my own. My luggage had been sent on ahead and so I had no change of clothes and no toiletries. The next day I departed as scheduled. On my flight I was not served a meal which I had preordered and the television monitor did not work. It didn't matter because I was not provided with headphones and so I spent the entire 7-hour flight with nothing to do. I was not able to sleep because I was in an aisle seat and the flight attendants were going back and forth and kept bumping into me all night long. When I arrived at my final destination (36 hours late) my luggage had been lost and that took another 40 hours to deliver to me. I requested compensation from the airline several times and was denied. The bottom line is that they simply do not care about their customers. At the very least they should have covered the cost of the hotel and refunded my luggage fee but they chose instead to be greedy and uncaring. Their attitude and lack of service are terrible. I regret having flown with them and in the future I will make every effort to avoid them."

From their staff advising my friend and I to each pay an additional 150 each to arrive one day early, only b/c one letter of my name was wrong on the ticket. Then after paying over 300 we were put on a the most packed airplane I have ever been on, with no water. We sat on the run way over an hour before taking flight and again at the airport, where we were suppose to catch our connecting Delta Flight. My friend and I literally ran through the airport, only to be turned away at the gate and left with a 3 hour lay over. So we spent an extra 300 dollars to not arrive any earlier than we originally planned for. The time we spent at the airport, we could have stayed in Vegas. I also wrote an email explaining in great detail the time of the plane departing and the time we arrived at the gate of our connecting flight- where were turned away. I got a generic email with a 25.00 credit that expired in 2 months! I am most frustrated because I feel like my email was not taken seriously.

I explained that I was told to tell her that so that I can board the plane with the ppl with kids and special needs. She said ""well if u feel like you need to board the plane early!""

We bought our tickets 9 months ag. We paid extra money for comfort class and to sit together since we are flying with a toddler. We were notified via email this morning that they split our party up due to double-booking. I called and spoke with an agent who said that there was nothing that she could do or offer us and that I shouldn't expect to have a flight or have my seats just because I purchased tickets.  Delta, if you overbook a flight, it is your problem and your fault. Not mine. We paid nearly $2000 to fly together in this row of seats. If someone who is flying solo double books one of our seats, then move that person (who is clearly okay with sitting alone). When I suggested this to the agent, she told me that Delta ""doesn't know which passengers are on our planes"" and ""does not have any way of contacting this person when we don't know who they are."" That's either the most negligent form of safety in the world or a complete lie. Either way, completely unacceptable. We've been loyal Skymiles members for years and we are ending our relationship with Delta. Complete disregard for customer service and safety."

Me and my husband were trying our hardest to catch a flight because his dad is dying and we wanted to make sure he got home to see him. We missed the check in time by 5 minutes and begged for someone to please let us on the flight. The lady at the desk called but didnt even mention our situation and just said rules are rules and I dont make them. Screw rules when there is someone's life on the line. Is an airline really not willing to help someone out who missed check in by 5 min. So he have to wait until tomorrow morning to fly out and we are praying that his dad can hold on until we arrive.

Today I got to the airport early to try and get on an earlier flight than my scheduled one because it became important to get home sooner on my weekly commute schedule. Even though there were many seats available, because I had booked a basic economy ticket the agent did not allow me to get on the earlier flight. So I have to stay in ORF airport for a lot of hours and Delta gets to give up the possibility of selling my seat on the later flight because they are unwilling to let a ticketed passenger on an earlier flight that had 20 ish seats empty. Flight after sold out. Totally stupid to do that to me just because I didnâ€™t spend an extra $40 on the initial ticket. You lost potential for an extra $500!"
1160,3,28,April,2019,Economy Class,Salt Lake City , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again. Most businesses would be out of business if they conducted business in this manor."

I have met some really nice workers that work there who were very helpful. My only issue is, a couple of the flight attendants there and back were rude and seemed as though they didnâ€™t want to be asked for assistance. Also, I look very young. So, I get I have to show my ID often. I highly suggest, the company speaks with their flight attendants about IDâ€™ing a guest before blatantly lying about not serving a drink thatâ€™s on the menu and also never coming back. I also asked for soft drinks or snacks and one of the flight attendants looked annoyed that I even asked her. Itâ€™s frustrating to get that type of service. As for the rest of the workers, they were great and very welcoming."
1162,1,26,April,2019,Economy Class,Edinburgh , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," I booked a flight with Delta to leave on 4/19/19 at 9 am, from Chicago to Phoenix. It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response â€œYou better runâ€! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didnâ€™t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they wonâ€™t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasnâ€™t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, wouldâ€™ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didnâ€™t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and Iâ€™m quoting â€œyou donâ€™t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didnâ€™t make the flight,â€ You shouldâ€™ve ran fasterâ€. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied â€œgood luckâ€. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when theyâ€™re 50 gates apart! Yes, Iâ€™ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you donâ€™t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely donâ€™t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, theyâ€™re extremely unprofessional and rude! To sum up this trip, Delta thank you for ruining my Easter! Advice: keep your phone handy, because all other passengers Iâ€™ve met in my 8hours of being in Detroit, everyone seemed to agree on one thing."

The Cabin crews are great but lack of smile. One Japanese cabin crew was the best. She is very polite, efficient and helpful with great smile. The main food from Tokyo is much better than food from Singapore bound. The plane is old B767 but clean with not bad entertainment. The seat is slightly on smaller side for economy size.

My husband walked up to flight attendant, and asked her if she would let us know when we would be able to change seats because we were assigned different seats. He didnâ€™t noticed it until time of boarding. Which we totally understood this was our mistake. The problem that really got to the both of us was her tone, she basically told him; the best thing he could do is ask someone to switch seats if he wanted to move. Her words wasnâ€™t the problem, it was the tone of her voice and look of annoyance in her face. She later walked up and down the isle without even looking at him. I decided to go ahead and move to seats that were empty, my husband followed. As she was passing beverages she then looked at us; without even acknowledging our move by saying anything that showed slightest concern that we were able to sit together, but said, you do realize youâ€™re sitting in seats that require being able to assistance in case of emergency? Again; nasty tone, no smile or anything to feel like we werenâ€™t annoying her. She then asked if we wanted any beverages but then told the attendant behind her to give it to us! I canâ€™t begin to explain completely how that woman made us feel, and hope sheâ€™s made aware that every customer on that flight deserves to be treated with respect and common courtesy!"

Worst flight experience of my life. I always thought Delta was a good airline, I've been learning lately that's not the case. I understand there can be delays due to weather but there was absolutely no effort on anyone's part to get us (there was a small group needing to connect) on an earlier flight, off the plane quickly or communicate with the gate that we were running late. After the fact all I got was attitude as I was passed off from person to person. I canceled my Delta card, will do everything in my power to never fly with them again."

We landed from Baltimore after a delay due to â€œsevere weatherâ€ but for some reason that â€œsevere weatherâ€ didnâ€™t keep my flight to Cancun from leaving Atlanta without approximately 30 passengers that were coming from Baltimore. And one particular customer service rep at the counter decided that it was a good idea to offer a voucher/discount for a hotel to one couple but not other families! Why the discrimination? She also provided the worst flights for us to choose from to make it an even horrible experience. But yet other customers had better flight options. I have never had this experience when flying. The worst customer service! Itâ€™s absolutely disappointing and at the same time surprising that Iâ€™ve had better contacts with Spirit. Southwest waits for its customers. And no discrimination between first class and those who canâ€™t afford it. Oh and the reps who refused to provide exceptional customer service at the Delta counter in Atlanta and made the experience even worse. So for those who choose to fly using Delta, thatâ€™s what you expect to deal with. If you have a layover, not even because of the weather, will they wait for you. They will put you on the worst available flight even though there are better flights with only first class seats available. Delta will not give up their first class seats to you because you paid for economy though â€œweatherâ€ screwed up your layover. They prefer to put you on the most inconvenient flight than to give up their available seats on the next better flight because the only seats left on that flight are first class. We waited to speak to a manager or supervisor but no one showed their face. No one felt it important to come speak to us."

The weather was clear. We were first told there were too many planes in the air for us to get on our plane. 3 hours later, we get on a plane. The wrong plane that is. We then wait on the wrongly boarded plane for 2 more hours as the ground crew leisurely empties the excess fuel from the wrongly boarded plane, because of a weight issue for landing at our destination. They also needed to get our luggage off whatever plane we were supposed to be on in the first place and had to load it on to this wrongly boarded plane that we were currently on. It really seemed as if nobody had any idea what was going on the entire time. My flight was only supposed to be an hour and a half, but took over 5 hours, because of incompetent workers.

In flight fairly standard service, cabin crew not overly observant or attentive, no facility to pre book seats prior to check in at the airport which by todayâ€™s standards is archaic and needles to say (as is so often mentioned within numerous reviews elsewhere) no seats available allowing my wife and I to sit together, the original seating arrangement put us 20 rows apart but after 10 minutes of pleading at check in we were permitted to sit a row apart both in the centre seats, it appears some booking sites appear to have preferential terms with Delta and this unfortunate enough not to book thru Delta preferred sites super to get the fodder seats with no concern for family wishing to travel the 7 hour flight together, one gets the sense that this is a regular occurrence with this airline as they do throw you some hope when they see how disappointed you are at the outset of your holiday to find you are sitting 20 rows apart fir the day, knowing we were to be returning 10 days later we asked how we could at least secure return flight seats together but were told we would have to call Delta next week from the states and the member of Delta staff gave us a reference number for the flight which transpired to be a completely bogus reference, after calling 3 times from New York we eventually waited 36 minutes to get connected to an operator who could assist us, eventually after much referencing etc we were first offered the emergency exit row fir $74 but that kind offer was hastily withdrawn when the operator discovered my wife was 53 and so â€too oldâ€ to fly in these seats and so it would appear the only option Delta can offer us is our 20 rows apart middle seated again for our return flights. They clearly treat passengers as fodder and have nobody it would seem in their system that can assist passengers who have already paid, they are a joke airline and I would strongly suggest you consider your options very carefully before coming anywhere near these people, just try lodging a query or complaint through their online system, like all there systems deliberately designed to make you give up the will to live before you can complete the laborious pointless questions hurdles, their website is so old design that it crashes if you spend any more than 3 minutes on it forcing you to have to return to the start again, joke service, joke airline, a throwback to 1970â€™s flying and best consigned to the bin, get your transatlantic tickets elsewhere even if you pay a bit more, at least you will be able to spend the flight with your family rather than the two 400lb snoring strangers I had to endure!!

But the only people that were Helpful was Jeanne, the representative in Alanta who tried to help. She went as far as trying to help us get a rental, this woman needs a raise! Only reason didnt take it was cause it was so late at night and was afraid of wrecking. Delta got us a flight the next morning but I showed up late for my grandmothers funeral!

Arrived at the gate at 10:25 to find boarding closed and another couple also at the gate. They spoke with the gate agent who said the time was moved back up - no notification of this. No one was paged. She was to check with her supervisor as the plane was still at the gate and get back to them. She never returned and the plane left us at the gate. Next flight out was 8:15 am the next day. No hotel vouchers because we should have been at the gate for the original boarding time! No accountability at all by anyone at Delta, no accommodation for the trouble. Very poor policy and customer service!

Pretty much all flights on time. FA's were all friendly to very friendly. Boeing 757/A321/737 I flew on had all personal screens with a vast choice of movies and TV series for free. Power plugs on almost all seats (2 in a row of 3 seats) for quick charge.  You can still stream movies and stuff via your cellphone/tablet through the on board wifi. Using messager like Whatsapp is free of charge. The beverage service is also good. On longer flights they usually offer you 2 rounds of nonalcoholic beverages for free. On the 3,5 hour SJO-ATL leg they came through with water twice on top of that. However, food is still a joke. On a 5 hour flight LAX-SJO all you get is a dry small sandwich. While planes, even the older ones look nice and clean I found dirty seat trays a couple of times which is not nice. Bring antibacterial wipes. So you have to eat at the airport before your flight.

Several times I asked a staff member about making my connecting flight. I was told she would check. This didnâ€™t happen. When we landed I had 40 min before departure. I asked a staff member about which gate to go to. He told me I could check the screen. He also said if I ran (Iâ€™m 71) I could make it. He said the airport was easy to navigate. It was not. He said there were others going on that same flight and the Air France to Cape Town staff knew we were coming. He said theyâ€™d hold the flight, not to worry. After I deplaned I couldnâ€™t find the screen so I ran, through security, through shops, onto a tram, asking at other gates where my gate was and was told by 1 person they were too busy. I got someone to tell me the gate number and after running as fast as I could I got to the gate, the plane was there but I was told boarding was closed. 14 hours later I was on my way to Johannesburg, not Cape Town.

When we arrived in Seattle, we approached the ticket counter about getting a wheel chair for my mother on to the plane and they asked our name and had new boarding passes waiting for us and we had wonderful seats in the first 5 rows of seating. We are so grateful for the help from all of your employees. We were weary travelers and they were so kind, helpful and efficient. The plane seemed brand new.

I am pleased with the value for money I get with Delta airlines in first. Check-in at YYZ was quick and friendly and our luggage was tagged priority. YYZ does not have a lounge in the US departures although it could be purchased. We boarded first and were offered a pre-flight drink. Both legs there and back were short so only snack and beverages were offered. Seats were comfortable and FAs were friendly and efficient. ATL is a great airport to transit through and is easy to transfer between flights/terminals and has good lounges. At both MIA and YYZ our luggage was on the belt promptly. Delta first class for this journey was about half of the cost compared to Canadian airlines flying the same route (although they flew direct). When traveling as a family of three, the extra 90 minutes going through ATL was worth the savings. All flight arrived on time and had great service."

The cabin crew were engaging and professional. In terms of service, Comfort+ gets an enhanced snack selection. I wish the choices were more substantial for a 4+ hour flight, but what they offered was good and we could take what we wanted. Did two rounds of full beverage service and a round of water service. LAX - DTW (redeye) - I liked that the cabin crew were so quiet during the flight. I never heard loud voices, and the announcements were limited to initial departure and final descent. Finally - new boarding process. It seems more organized, especially with the pillars. However, two things kind of irked me: 1) Delta created all of these new boarding groups, yet still had and additional three ""special"" (those needing a little extra time, active military and those with children under two). I think one ""special"" boarding will do, and 2) There were no pillars for Main 3 and Basic Economy (last two boarding groups). This, along with the gate agent's announcements, seemed condescending to the passengers in these groups. I know these groups represent passengers in the lower fare categories, but they still paid for the service and really should not be singled out."
1187,10,28,March,2019,Economy Class,Boston , Cincinnati       , Ft Myers     ,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  We had planned a quick 4-day getaway thru Expedia with our two kids to Puerto Vallarta for spring break. The flight to Mexico was with Aeromexico (in partnership with Delta). We arrived at the MSP airport the morning of departure and the parking garage was full so we were directed to park at a different airport, which we did, but had to take two light rails and drag two kids and our luggage up and down countless escalators and long corridors before we reached the Delta desk to check in (nearly an hour later). We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldnâ€™t help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a â€˜Hail Maryâ€™ idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldnâ€™t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we â€œno-showedâ€ they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there werenâ€™t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldnâ€™t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but Iâ€™m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta. Though they partner with Aeromexico and have a help desk in the airport, they did absolutely nothing to help us!"

Boarding was disorganized, all that the gate agents cared about was getting first class on before everyone else. However, once we got onboard, the flight attendants provided great care and were very cheerful. The inflight entertainment was amazing, as there were over 100 movies on a domestic flight, although Delta does charge for headphones (you can bring your own free of charge). The food was your average American pretzels & peanuts, but they also provided cookies, which are by far one of the best free snacks offered on a US carrier. The bathrooms were pretty clean and our bag was on the carousel within 5 minutes. Delta is an above average airline and is not as overpriced as American.

Our experience with Delta was pretty mixed. Our flights from Frankfurt to Atlanta were not too bad. Food was okay. Ground service was great as Delta has a good boarding process which we really liked. The economy seats were a little bit uncomfortable if you compare them to other airlines. The IFE system has lots of films series and what not, Sadly you cannot adjust the angle of the screen which is not good as it is hard to see anything when the person in front of you pushs the seat back. The second segment from ATL to CUN was also okay and only a short 2hrs flight, same counts for the way back CUN to ATL. Then it all started...for the last segment we thought, lets go comfort and have better experience. We had seats in row 21 (E+F) next to emergency exit. It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay. Delta wont be my first choice but it was okay, except the fact it was unbelievably cold on the plane especially on that specific seat."

First when boarding 3 times we had to stop Delta representatives from tagging our bags with the wrong tags. When we boarded the flight it was blowing hot air into the cabin. Once the flight began the wifi took an hour to come up and while trying to watch a movie I finally gave up. First the movie shut off and wouldn't restart. The second movie kept freezing and 2 attempts later I gave in. Once we were on the ground the baggage handling crew didn't get not only our bag but also 4 other family's bags off the plane in time to be able to clear customs and make our connecting flight. When we informed the gate representative of the situation they sent us to a help desk that was closed. After raising a little sand we were finally given a supervisor that basically said that they couldn't help us. That security goes home at 8pm and you are just or of luck. Extremely poor service, extremely poorly handled by delta reps on the ground.

We were held up in customs because there were not enough officers to get people through in a timely manner. Then, we arrived at our gate and Constance (a supervisor) would not let us board the plane even though we had gone through security, through customsâ€”and our plane was still sitting at the end of the jetway! We were franticâ€”but she would not let us board! Instead, we waited 6hrs for another flight. Does not make sense why this happened."

The guys distributing the food ignored me once, ignored me twice, upon asking they ignored me again. When an air-hostess came to pick up garbage I had to ask her for food again and finally the food was served. Also, before the flight departed they asked all the passengers to get their carry-on trolley-bags to be checked-in, I had to do the same with only one trolley bag. Later, I found that the seat carry-on cabins had plenty of space everywhere! Annoying airline in simple words!"

I had 10 minutes to make the jump flight due to a slight delay of when we landed. When finally making it to the plane I asked two flight attendants on the plane how long the flight is, one of the guys answered with â€œhelloâ€ in a condensing tone. I responded with the same question, how long is the flight (I was not rude but tired and out of breath), his response with an absolutely rude and condescending smile was â€œhelloâ€. Then both the lady attendant and male attendant laughed at me and said, boy heâ€™s rude and then laughed again. I was shocked and never did receive an answer to my simple question. My flight from Austin to Salt Lake was a horrible flight. Iâ€™m 6â€™1â€ and my knees were literally smashed against the seat in front of me; one offering of a beverage for a flight that is just over two hours. I will never fly Delta again. Oh, and one of the photos below shows mold on the wind shade. Nasty!"

My flight was delayed twice and then delayed due to weather. I asked for a voucher for the same flights on a different weekend and was only given a credit with their airline for the same amount. The reason I booked this flight was because I couldn't afford anything more, however now all the flights are more expensive. now I have tried to rebook for a different weekend and the ticket is 40 dollars more. After trying to figure out how to enter my credit number in online I was lost and frustrated. Called the company and can only do it over the phone, and now was forced to pay an additional 20$ to the 40$ increase already, to a ""main cabin fee"" vs basic economy(which I originally purchased) because it is their policy. After much complaining and speaking with supervisors I was finally given the basic economy price-still 40$ more than my originally purchased ticket. I am grateful for the basic economy price, but frustrated with the entire situation when I feel as a consumer I should have been given a service for the original price I paid in the beginning."

Really bad experience, our flight was delayed for 2 hours. Then when we were actually landed, we were sitting on the air strip for 40 minutes after the attendants were telling us to remain seated and it would be only a ""few"" minutes until we were ready to leave the plane. After a frustrating 2 hour delay, many passengers who had to use the restroom but were told to remain in their seats it was really annoying and frustrating. We read good reviews about this airline but unfortunately we were the unlucky few. Even after all of the inconvenience we were not even offered any type of reimbursements, or perks for the inconvenience. They didn't even offer refreshments like juice or soda."

This weekend they had a 3.5 hr delay in DTW due to equipment that was known at least 4.5 hrs ahead of scheduled departure and refused to put stranded DTW passengers on an open and on time United flight to SBN. Delta offered nothing including no food, no drink and charged amex platinum holders $29 skyclub. So inconsiderate with a 3.5 hr delay it should have beem comp'd. No concern for passengers. Fly United or American from now on."

First and last time I use Delta. Every flight was overbooked and they kept requesting volunteers to take other flights, 2 of our 4 flights were delayed, one flight delay caused us to miss another flight and we were stuck at the airport for hours. Every plane had to do an involuntary bag check because there was no room left on the plane. People were extremely rude. I canâ€™t believe this airline has stayed in business. Never again."

Had booked my flights Nov 2018 and yet was the last person to get a seat on the return from Atlanta to Toronto. Not only that but the gate personnel asked me to leave my carry-on bag at the gate as the plane was full and had been overbooked. I got the seat the last minute and when I arrived in Toronto, I found out my carry-on luggage was left in Atlanta with my winter jacket, phone charger and personal belongings in it.

Flights left on time and  arrived on time or early. Only one delay, which was expected, due to snowstorm in Boston. Delta communication regarding this delay was timely and accurate. I realized the evening I arrived home that I had left my Kindle in the seat pocket. The following day I opened a Lost Item Report with the airline. I did not have much hope that my Kindle would be found and returned. I received daily emails from Delta, and after 8 days the email stated that an item matching the one described by me was found. I followed the instructions for the item to be mailed to me. To my delight, I did receive my Kindle back and much quicker than stated in the emails! It is reassuring that an airline would take the time and effort to locate my Kindle and return it to me. This trip was my third in one month's time, the other 2 trips taken with a different major airline. Every one of those other trips resulted in at least a 2 1/2 hour delay for various reasons, some understandable and most not. Lack of communication from the other major airline, only one time was compensation offered, and each delay resulted in doubling the time it should have taken to travel to the destinations. Delta will be my first choice when planning my next travel adventure."

Complete waste and complete utter disrespect by the customer service department! My flight was â€œrescheduledâ€ for an earlier time when I was an hour early. The lady at the counter was very rude and told me I had to buy an additional ticket to get home on top of a round trip ticket I originally purchased. And of course another hotel room and missing a day of work. Unorganized. Never flying with delta again!

For the round trip, every flight was extremely late in it's boarding. Then, all of a sudden, our last flight got delayed by 3 hours. When we asked why, the Delta rep told us it was because of maintenance that the plane underwent earlier that morning, which apparently pushed everything behind schedule. What makes no sense is the fact that if the maintenance was undertaken in the morning and the schedule pushed back so much, why did it take until 10 minutes before out flight to make us aware of the huge delay? And why was the situation not rectified in any way? We did not receive any kind of compensation at all, and the only recognition of their fault was in one line in an email reading 'Apologies for the inconvenience.' This apology did not help me get to work the following day like I had planned. And I don't need a stupid travel voucher from this terrible company. I will never fly with Delta Airlines again and I hope those that do have much better experiences than I did."

Donâ€™t leave storage space for economy. Force economy passengers to check their bags in so that they can wait an hour to find their bag.

I received a seat on the first leg of the flight and was placed on the stand-by list for the second leg. I am flabbergasted that I was not made aware of the stipulations of Deltaâ€™s â€œBasic Economyâ€ fare prior to purchase and  I received NO notification upon check-in of the fact that there was a chance I would not be flying all the way home tonight. After google informed me of my impending doom (this information was very hard to find on Deltaâ€™s website), I downloaded the Delta app in a panic. Thankfully, of the 21 people on the stand-by list, I was second in line. Surprisingly, there appeared to be 60 open seats. Because I purchased the basic fare, I had no option to upgrade. Why not just assign these open seats to individuals at purchase? Why not be transparent about the robbery of charging $600 for a â€œnormalâ€ fare while tricking those of us who canâ€™t afford that into a â€œbasicâ€ fare that includes the chance of being stranded? Why guarantee me a flight for half of my trip and then leave me hanging in some strange city? This is a despicable way to do business. I will not be flying with Delta again.

From rude women that check you in to a freezing cold flight to delays to cancellations it seems Iâ€™ve been through it all. I make it a point to fly delta because I thought they were a pretty established airline (the prices reflect so). The customer service outside of the aircraft may be the worst!! I am about to throw in the towel on this airline. On this experience they delayed my flight from Erie 4 times which made us late to our connecting flight, I get to the gate completely out of breath to see that they locked the door on time (so they say) with 4 people not on the plane (that I saw). The only good experience I had in the half way flight just now was how calm the gentleman was with me (I was very irate) rebooking my ticket for the next day. Shame on delta."

The last row seat from Hawaii to LA was the worst flight in all my decades of flying. The seat doesn't recline and the seat in front of you is un your lap with no room at all to move. No leg room in the last row, other rows we were in on this trip were fine. I will never fly Delta again. They should teach the crew how to be customer friendly. The flight is to take off in 40 minutes and the staff is just chatting instead of helping the line of us that have been standing here over an hour from our connecting flight. Terrible people.

She said that it comes down to the day and how busy the flight is, and in her own words â€œcomes down to the ticket agent and if they want to waive that fee or notâ€. I waited until everyone else was on board and pleaded with the ticket agent to help me out but they drug there feet and â€œthought about itâ€ and chatted with each other about non work related subjects until it was to late and they closed the doors with me standing there.

The seat on this 767 was more comfortable than the one on the A330, though legroom was a bit tight. However, the aircraft looked tired, and the IFE was a bit outdated. Meal service was good, providing this was a domestic flight. The flight departed and arrived on time, but it took longer than normal for our luggage to arrive at the carousel at JFK.

Flight crew are typically very nice and professional. Flights are more often on time than late, but when they are late they do not announce it until the last moment or even give wrong information to make it appear that the flight is not as delayed as it is and then they keep pushing official departure time by a couple of minutes at times until they reach the real departure time which makes it very hard to plan anything (connections, business, rides) in a reliable fashion. They will say that the flight wonâ€™t take off at 5 but 5.15, at 5.10 they say it will take off at 5.45, at 5.30 they say it will take off at 6, until they finally admit that that departure is delayed by 1.5 hours and it will happen at 6.30. In the meantime you have to change your subsequent plans 5 times due to incorrect information. Food served is extremely unhealthy. Beverages okay with wide variety of options."

However, Delta changed their mileage plan last year making it impossible to get any higher than gold status (downgraded from platinum). This made me start shopping tickets, and I noticed they were about $200 more per ticket than the next cheapest airline for months. I tried to call, and get them to price match so I could justify the $ to stay with the them, but was told they could not match prices unless it was the exact route. For someone who has been with them for so long, I feel unappreciated, and have been flying satisfactorily with American Airlines for the past couple months for much less money.

Onboard, the 2-4-2 configuration was among my preferred one (I purposely booked flights based on the equipment). However, the seat did not seem comfortable (compare to other economy seats I've experienced). Cabin staff were courteous and pleasant. A cold meal (quite good), a separate snack service (though very small), and 3 rounds of beverage service were offered for this 5.5-hour flight; not bad at all.

Besides the inexperienced fellow passengers who needed constant getting up and down during my flight and who shouted and laughed out loud at films, I had a terrific experience. I gave up on Delta several years ago, but booked a ticket well in advance for an extremely reasonable price. My mileage statement reflected this as I did not get 100% mileage, but it was to be expected. The flight attendants went out of their way to call me by my name, the food was good and served on Alessi service ware with real silverware (plastic cups), the AVOD has an incredible amount of movies and television shows to watch, the FA actually cleaned the toilets, and the seat comfort in premium economy was satisfying enough. We had no delays or drama on either of my journeys to and from the US from Japan. If the price is right, I will consider flying Delta again in the future as I was satisfied and felt it was good value for money."

Unlike domestic flights in US, Delta's cabin service on international routes (especially on those operated by its Tokyo Narita hub) is far better than expected. Both main meal and snacks were great. There were a good variety of movies. However, a search function is suggested since it's really hard to find one just by scrolling. The ground service however, could be improved. Majority of airlines operated in Changi airport offers early checkin service which allows passengers to drop their bags 24 hours in advance. It's specifically useful for early morning flights like this one."

Usually don't fly with Delta, but thought to give it a try. My flight was booked for Tuesday, 3pm. Got to the airport, to the gate that was on the screen. The gate doesn't show my flight, shows different flight. We started asking where is our flight information, why our flight is not on the gate screen. First, no Delta representatives were even there, finally few Delta employees showed up, nobody knows what's going on and why our flight is not on the gate's screen. The Delta representative got confused didn't understand what we were asking and multiple people were asking the same. After a while she realized what's going on but wasn't sure why our flight is not there. Then we were told that our flight was delayed by half an hour. After about an hour they told us the flight was delayed by another hour, after another hour the flight was cancelled! So frustrating! It's a short flight from SLC to SJC.. they rebooked us for 3 hours later from a different gate, far from the original. And they don't even know if they are going to make this flight. I have a midterm exam that i must attend for my school. I gave myself enough buffer from arrival to the exam time. Now I'm not gonna make it to my exam! Very stressful!! It's not a long flight (<2 hours) and with no layover. I signed for the skymiles account with Delta.. Now I'll cancel it and will never fly with them again."

Most ridiculous experience Iâ€™ve ever had with an airline! Delta dropped the ball so many times over the last 48 hours that Iâ€™m seriously considering never using them again. Iâ€™m thankful they realized a problem with the plane before we took off, but they were seriously incompetent from that point on. We unboarded the plane around midnight, weâ€™re told that we were on our own to find a hotel (at midnight), but they ended up helping some people secure a hotel, taxi, etc from a different kiosk. We ended up sleeping on a freezing cold concrete floor by the baggage claim, on one of the coldest night Maui has had in 10 years. It was pouring rain and windy as hell. They were actually getting snow on the peaks of Haleakala. We were told to go grab our luggage, but TSA was closed once we got down there, so we werenâ€™t able to go back upstairs in the warm enclosure. Those who stayed up there were given blankets, pillows, and water, but the 6 of us downstairs were left to fend for ourselves. And thatâ€™s just weâ€™re the drama began. One thing after another, over and over again, we dealt with issues from the Delta employees. People who didnâ€™t know what they were doing whatsoever. More delays, sending info for the wrong runway, and BS from employees in Utah once we finally landed, 3 hours late, at 2:30 AM. 48 hours of no sleep, rude and ignorant employees, and no info relayed to those of us on the flight. Letâ€™s just say that Iâ€™m glad to be home! They need more training on how to deal with these kind of situations, and if youâ€™re going to be able to compensate some, you need to compensate all."

The flight out of Chattanooga was delayed that caused me to not get to Atlanta and off the plane until 5:23pm and my flight left at 5:29p. There was 0 communication between anyone to alert the next flight that there were multiple people that were coming from the delayed flight to hold or wait or do something so that we could all make it on the next flight out to Tampa. 27 people waiting on stand by for the next flight out. It's absolutely ridiculous that Delta did nothing to help their passengers get to original flight or help with getting on an additional flight out that was guaranteed a spot. I am beyond irritated with this airline, Southwest would have offered more assistance and help, I'm surprised Delta did not."

Delta Air Lines is by far the worst experience Iâ€™ve had in many years of travel. Out of four legs of flights in a round trip, 3 were delayed, one by over an hour. In an attempt to reschedule one of my flights for a more advantageous time, I was told by a very rude gate agent that nothing could be done without being a platinum member. In a phone conversation involving the same issue, the agent hung up on me with no provocation. This airline does not have poor customer service, it has no customer service. I will avoid flying Delta at all costs in the future."

I have had multiple bad experiences with Delta, however, I have never written a review. Everyone has a bad day, right? Well this last time was it for us. We will never fly Delta again if we can help it. Our luggage was list, however, that wasnâ€™t the problem. How it was handled was the problem. We got the run around a lot while in a foreign country, and are still dealing with things a few weeks later. Supporting businesses that care for their customers is very important to me. Clearly it wasnâ€™t important for Delta. We did have kind personnel on most of the flights, and some of the customer representatives were nice. Unfortunately not all were, but the main issue lies with Delta and their policies and procedures. I wouldnâ€™t recommend Delta to anyone I know."

Before departure the pilot notified the passengers and crew there would be flurries on decent and landing. Well, mother nature had a little more snow in store for flight 2784. Just east of Seatle we were flying in blinding snow with an uncomfortable amount of turbulant air but the crew and the pilots were cool under pressure and their calm demeanor coupled with their preparedness put the cabin at ease. The pilots have nerves of steel and a flawless job landing the aircraft in snow and ice."

This has been the worst flying experience Iâ€™ve ever had in my life. They boarded the plane, drove to the runway, and turned around due to bad weather. The pilot never made any announcement about what was going on and we were on the runway for 2 hours for a 3.5 hour flight! They deplaned us and were not accommodating. The plane got delayed from 10:55 pm to 11:30 am the next day. They made all of the passengers sleep in the airport unless they paid for a hotel on their own. After all of the delays the staff managed to mess up my delayed boarding pass and didnâ€™t even book a connecting flight like they told me. I only knew it wasnâ€™t booked because I wasnâ€™t confident and double checked. I will never fly with them again and neither should you!"

We originally booked a flight from BWI to Merida Mexico for my godson's wedding. Delta canceled the flight and a representative from Delta rebooked us on a flight from BWI to Atlanta to Mexico city to merida. When we checked our flight the night before we joked that Delta was offering up to $500 to give up your seat. It was imperative for us to be in Merida by 5 pm for the rehearsal and dinner so that was not an option. On the leg of the flight from Atlanta to mexico city we only had a half hour to get from terminal A to terminal F. Atlanta is a large airport and we had to get from one side to the other. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes prior to departure. The delta rep at the gate said our seats had been sold and we needed to get on another flight. The next flight to Mexico city wasnt until 4 hours later and the flight from mexico city was also much later. Long story short we did not arrive in Merida until 230 am the next day. Needless to say we missed the wedding rehearsal and dinner. We filed a complaint with Delta and their canned response was basically saying that they were disappointed we had a bad experience and sorry their agent was not accommodating and they were forwarding our complaint to customer service. We will never fly Delta again

There was a guy that refused to get out of my assigned seat even after both staff asked politely. Without causing a ruckus they directed me to a new seat which was even better with more leg room which is a premium for me since Iâ€™m very tall. They didnâ€™t have to do what they did and I know plenty of flight attendants who wouldâ€™ve handled the situation completely differently. I am very grateful!

After wasting half my day, they gave me a bag of unsalted almonds and said â€œwe apologizeâ€. Needless to say I am furious and my daughterâ€™s trip to Disney World was ruined by their incompetence. Donâ€™t use this airline if you can avoid it. You may end up wasting hundreds or thousands of dollars."

Coming from SFO, I had a layover in Atlanta before arriving in Burlington. My flight was scheduled to land at 10:20pm but we did not get to the plane until close to 11pm. After getting off the plane, I waited for awhile and I did not see my luggage. By the time my luggage was located at the service desk, it was already 12am and I was told that my luggage did not get delivered and was still in Atlanta. It was freezing cold in Vermont, I did not have my luggage or any change of clothes. I had work in the morning and was notified that my luggage would arrive by 10am. My luggage did not get delivered to my hotel until 5pm the next day, which surpassed the 6hour. The company did not compensate my loss with anything. No extra miles, ride to my hotel, or anything to help me get through the freezing cold weather. By the time I found news of my luggage, everything was closed already. If I didn't already have an account with Delta or if the flights to Vermont was limited, I would definitely choose another Airline. But after this experience, I don't think I would want to fly with Delta again."

Our plane took off from Atlanta and made it to Des Moines then was turned around and sent back to Atlanta because of weather. Not Deltas fault at all. But when we got back to Atlanta we were told the flight would be leaving in the morning and they werenâ€™t going to do anything for us so we just had to sleep in the airport. Then the next morning we get on the plane and have to wait for almost an hour because they couldnâ€™t seem to coordinate filling the plane back up with fuel from the previous night! Evidently 8 hours isnâ€™t enough time to put some fuel in an airplane. When we finally made it to Des Moines the 2nd time they told us we couldnâ€™t land again and we were running out of fuel so we could only wait for 45 minutes before weâ€™d have to re route to St Louis. An hour went by and we still couldnâ€™t land so we ended up in Kansas City where they told us we werenâ€™t allowed off the plane. Then it turned into oh you can get off but canâ€™t get back on. Then it was â€œif we canâ€™t land in Des Moines this time we are going to Atlanta so if you want off get off and we will pull your checked bags.â€ So we got off and inside the airport we were told to go to ticketing to have our bags pulled from the plane. At ticketing we were told to go to the baggage office. At the baggage office we were told â€œsorry you arenâ€™t getting your bags. Theyâ€™ll be wherever the plane ends up.â€ Which at this time was looking like it was going to be Atlanta. So naturally we went back to the plane where they told us sorry you already got off and thereâ€™s no way we can get you your bag. Delta has been nothing but horrible and unorganized through this whole thing and never has been able to help us out or do anything for us. I will never fly Delta again.

My daughter and I moved to empty seats opposite each other, the stewardess asked and said we had to pay more for those empty seats and made us move back (even tho a minute earlier I watched the gate agent give a free upgrade to a gal boarding). The stewardess was unpleasant, not only ordered us back to our assigned seats but also made several others move, even just across the aisle. What was also interesting is I asked her name and she pulled her smock/jacket over where I could see her badge, reached down and tucked the badge completely out of reach. I moved one seat back so my daughter and I could each have separate rows and she made me move back â€œsomeone is sitting in that seatâ€ which of course was a lie as no one boarded. An unpleasant experience with an very unpleasant stewardess."

After what I had already paid for the ticket they required a $200 change fee. Now I could understand if I was canceling to go with another airline or cancel altogether. I sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours and now the needs of the trip have changed due to flight delays etc. I understand this is no ones fault, but I don't understand when seats are available on another flight, same day, just different time they charge especially with a 24 hour notice! I will definitely reconsider flights in the future as no one plans for a needed change, but there is also no compassion with this company!"

1245,1,28,January,2019,Economy Class,New York JFK , London      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I've flown Delta's new A350 at least 8 times in the past year on transatlantic and transpacific routes from Detroit to China and Europe. I am not impressed with Delta's new flagship. In economy class, the aisles are very narrow and you are constantly getting bumped by flight attendants and passengers if you're in the aisle seat. Seats themselves are narrower than on other Delta aircraft, although legroom is adequate. The number of bathrooms in economy is seriously inadequate. Most disturbing, though, is the quality of the interior. It is very evident that costs were cut, as things are breaking down quickly. On this current flight, the window shade was stuck in the closed position as it looked like it was off-track. On another flight, it was a broken lavatory door. On a third flight, the lavatory light didn't work so you had to use the facility in total darkness. And most annoying, the entertainment system didn't work on yet another flight so all passengers were out of luck, no compensation was offered. I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member and at the point where I'm purposely seeking out either A330 or 777 aircraft on my frequent trips to Europe where possible. Those older aircraft are more spacious and comfortable, and their interior fittings much more durable and reliable. It will be a sad day when the A350 replaces these other aircraft unless Delta does something to improve it."

Cheerful, friendly crew; on time flights; generous and helpful inflight service; and orderly boarding â€” all combined to make for a truly satisfying trip. I am traveling on Delta more frequently and noticing continuing improvements. On these non stop flights we had two runs of beverages and snacks service - four choices from peanuts, Kind bar, cookies and pretzel mix! Attendants helped with stashing bags and winter jackets into overhead compartments. Personal entertainment screens were easy to use - a good selection of current movies. On the way out, they had no earphones to give out and I had not brought my own - so missed out on the entertainment. On the return, head phones were sold for two dollars! Both arrivals were ahead of schedule. Easy, comfortable trip from NYC to SLC in larger aircraft. Delta is the best option for this route."

Even though there were 6 of us in the flight they didnâ€™t hold it for 10 minutes for us even though Delta caused the delay. I didnâ€™t get to SLC until 24 hours later. Not happy.
1248,1,26,January,2019,Economy Class,Pittsburgh , Atlanta        , Key West     ,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Verified ,"  My husband and I had flown Delta to Seattle for holiday. I had previously flown Delta and loved the airline and had often paid more to book with Delta. But,I hadn't traveled via air for about 3 years so this trip was a shocker. The day of our return flight was foggy earlier in the day. Flights had been delayed earlier but not bad and I had flown in much worse fog before. Our flight was in the evening and it hadn't been foggy for at least 6 hours. However, about an hour before our departure Delta canceled a few flights including ours. They rebooked us on a flight leaving at about 11am the next morning and handed us meal vouchers that only covered a basic Subway sandwich with old browning veges. We asked the Delta agent for help and were booked on a flight that was leaving that night but the agent said it was weird because only about 5 other passengers were booked. We thought that was great of Delta to open another flight and expected the flight to fill quickly with the other stranded passengers. But a few minutes later we saw a man with a Delta badge approach the agent and tell her the flight was only to transport a pilot and co pilot with a full sized empty plane to salt lake city (our destination) and no passengers were allowed because there wasn't a flight crew.  Why was that flight allowed to leave and not ours? Why didn't Delta scramble and come up with a crew for that flight!? What a waste. I'm not a crier, especially in public but I couldn't hold back the tears and it's not like there is anywhere secluded to go in an airport for privacy. So my husband and I had to stay the night in the airport and watched for openings on earlier flights. Thankfully we found a flight out at about 6am but we were up all night hungry, exhausted and I was completely humiliated. I had also called Delta's customer service asking for help but they said to talk with the agent at the airport. It was especially important for us to get back to Salt Lake because I had a surgery consultation at 10am in Salt Lake, that I had been waiting about 5 months for. We went straight from the airport to the appointment disheveled and gross. Ironically my appointment was for my foot which was swollen like a melon after sitting in the airport for over 12 hours. I used to recommend Delta to everyone but they've changed. I won't fly Delta and do yourself a favor and choose an airline that at least pretends to care."
1249,1,26,January,2019,Economy Class,Guatemala , Baltimore Washington , Atlanta     ,Business,United States, Trip Verified ,  Flight was delayed leaving Birmingham and We were told multiple times by the flight crew that we would make our flights. My son was on my connecting flight in Atlanta and he told the gate agent we were on the ground and that I had his heart medication. I ran to the plane and the door was shut a minute before I got there which was Still prior to when the flight was scheduled to leave. The gate agent rudely told me that if I flew more often I would understand the flight rules to close the door 10 minutes before departure time. I am a silver delta member and have flown Delta for over 25 years. Even when I had choices on other airlines I would do my best to select Delta over American. That now has obviously changed. This was the worst experience I have ever experienced with Delta or any other airline. I am truly disappointed.

I was looking to go to NJ for my aunt's funeral on 1/22/ to 1/24/2019. I never booked that flight. I was also looking to book a flight for 2/1/2019 to Orlando for my nephew's birthday. I thought I booked that flight. Today, my niece asked me to send her my flight information, and when I went to do so, I realized my trip is to NJ, not Orlando. I called Delta and explained the mistake. I booked this 4 days ago. Delta won't do anything. So that's $416 lost. No refund, no credit, no partial credit. Now the flights to Orlando are much higher-at least on Delta. I am a Skymiles member as well as a Skymiles credit card holder. That does not mean much to Delta. My husband, a Platinum member, insists we fly Delta even when the flights are more money. I suppose we will be taking some separate flights in the future."

Now that we are finally on the plane after waiting 12 hours and 34 min, there are technical difficulties and we will have to unboard the plane.

There were several of us flying the exact UK to Vegas to San Diego flight and none of us had our luggage in San Diego. At the lost/delayed baggage office they took our details and they told us that the bag would be delivered to my house by 11pm that night. Frankly I was really sceptical but the bag was delivered that night by 11 pm, just as promised. I was really impressed. At the end of day, it was only a tiny inconvenience and they really did exactly what they said they would do. Things can happen at 1st port of entry into the USA which can cause onward baggage delays (like government shutdown, for instance). Thatâ€™s not the airlineâ€™s fault, but what they do after something like this, is what really counts. And Delta came through!"

So, which means I had to pay for all the expenses including transport to go the hotel, food, and hotel charge with 20% discount. They only mentioned they cannot do anything if they delay the departure time because of the weather. This is highly disappointing.

Delta Air Lines are supposed to be an American flag carrier, and they promote their Delta One business class product as a premier class. First, the Delta Lounge at JFK is nothing short of disgusting. The lounge itself is shabby, and the queue to the bar was massive. Upon finally getting to the bar, the staff try to charge you for the drinks. The food, (help yourself), is truly of such poor quality you would not feed to your dog. Served on paper bowls, from school meal-esque vats, of some kind of watery curry on boiled rice. The flight itself was dreadful, onboard some ancient, Airbus 330-200, presumably inherited from USAir. Terrible crew, who merely served the meal as quickly as possible, and then disappeared to the galley. The meal, per se, was ghastly. I have flown American Airlines, British Airways, and Virgin Atlantic trans-Atlantic, and Delta Airlines set the new low standard; not Business Class, but no class whatsoever. Delta treat their passengers with contempt, by offering this rubbish service. The seat comfort was unbearable too."

I had not flown Delta for over 20 years, and only did so due to the Virgin Atlantic code share. I was intrigued to try their much vaunted Delta One business class. The aircraft was an old B-767-300, which was in awful shape. The so-called business class was atrocious, and must be at least 20 years out of date. I thought British Airways Club Class was bad, but this was worse. The food onboard was inedible, and the wine selection poor. The ONLY good thing about Delta Airlines, was the use of the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class lounge at Heathrow. Other than that, there was nothing to commend about this flight, or indeed this airline. Why to American carriers persist with such ancient aircraft trans-Atlantic, and their incredibly uncomfortable business class seats."

Purchased tickets with customer service by phone asked for 2 seats right beside each other and specifically asked how many pieces of luggage each passenger can check in? The sales agent responded 2 bags each for first class! The next day we went to the Delta counter to board our flight and the counter agent only said that we were aloud 1 bag to Key West. Had to leave a piece of luggage the airport! Boarded the plane to find out that our seats were not together! Landed at Atlanta airport to eventually find out that our connecting flight was cancelled! Had to get a taxi to a hotel that was discounted and not paid and only having the clothes that we were wearing and nothing else! We left at 3:00am to catch our flight for 5:30am! The Delta agents advised us that we will not receive new boarding passes and that we will have to use our existing boarding passes from the day before, needless to say I had a terrible experience with security because our boarding passes were for yesterday. I finally boarded the plane to find out that the piolets did not receive to necessary paperwork to fly to Key West! We waited 1 hour for someone to hand deliver the paperwork while on the runway. Finally landed in Key West to find out that my luggage and clothing was soaked! Still having issues with baggage claims. They rejected my claim stating that the verbal claim was put in Dec 2nd 2018 when I purchased my tickets December 19th and actually did not land in Key West till Dec 21st when I called about my luggage.

Check in staff at all airports were excellent, professional and helpful (including Dulles where we started from). Boarding was done in an organized way. We bought our tickets online and it was not clear that we had to pay extra for each bag. Two flights (Dulles to Atlanta and Atlanta to Guatemala just before Christmas) were seriously overbooked and that contributed to significant delays. Air steward conduct was mixed. On the way there, all the stewards were friendly and courteous. On the way back from Guatemala city, the male steward in economy was grumpy and unhelpful. The final straw was near and of flight when he trapped me in a by now dirty bathroom with urine on floor by not moving his beverage-snacks cart and continuing to unload his trays. When he continued unloading, I insisted he move his cart and let me out. Customers should not have to demand to be allowed out of dirty bathrooms. There was no apology. The other airline stewards were not polite or friendly when we disembarked at Atlanta. One Asian stewardess was kind to our daughter though and gave her extra cookies as she was hungry. However, on the next flight from Atlanta to Baltimore all the stewards in both first class and economy were very gracious to economy passengers as well. Food was terrible on all flights. I have never experienced international flights with such poor food options (poor quality cookies and snacks). We could only buy a box of decent snacks on one flight. Food options definitely need to be vastly improved especially on international flights. Overall, much to be commended but also much to be improved."

When we boarded to our surprise it was a Delta Air Lines Plane and we were given seating grade equivalent to Virgin`s Economy X. Not what we paid for. The Service is very low standard compered to Virgin`s Premium Economy. Firstly the pillow had dirty marks and hair all over it, but they were able to find me a clean one. The seats are narrower than Virgin`s Premium Economy. The hostess admitted she did not know the difference between the food packages and was handing out different ones to what passengers asked for. She rips them open to see & check if she got the right one. I got a ripped open one, no bother complaining. The bread rolls they brought around were literally rock cakes. Coffee served was cold and to get anything extra to drink was very difficult. When the hostess finally brought some water around she split it over me.  Every seat is supposed to have a travel pack and mine missed out, no big deal but just part of the low grade service and care. The pocket that holds the instructions etc, still had the previous passengers rubbish. No Do Not Wake Signs as other Airlines have, so when you take off at 10.45 pm you do not really want to be disturbed 4-5 hours later, but Delta does. I suggest Delta Airlines stick to domestic travel in USA & Canada what they do good at, But with International Travel their service including Staff, Seating, Passenger Comforts, Quality of Food is flat out getting 1 Star. Warning : Check who you book with and make sure you are not transferred to Delta Air lines."
1265,8,2,January,2019,First Class,Atlanta , Houston        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Flew Delta Comfort+ from Springfield to Greenville via Atlanta. Flight delayed in Springfield 7 times. First explanation was a weather issue then changed to a maintenance issue then to a crew timed out issue at which point it became obvious it was nothing more than a lying issue. Connecting flight in Atlanta leaves on time at 10:29 pm, unfortunately we do not arrive until 11:30 pm. Directed to 3 different agent locations then to Baggage Claim area. Approximately 150 people standing in line at midnight after being stranded by Delta. After 2 hrs of standing we are close enough to make out the Delta employee stating that Delta will rebook your flight and nothing more. Someone asked about overnight accommodations and was told there were plenty of chairs in the terminal. Another person asked for a meal voucher and was told Delta does not provide meal vouchers. It was suggested that if anyone got a hotel room they could try to apply for up to $100 in reimbursement after the first of the year. After watching the Delta agents treatment of the customers in front of them and twice hearing an agent tell a customer they did not like their attitude and would have them arrested we exited the line. I am not adept at kissing someone's butt while they treat me like an animal and it had become apparent that Delta's agents were fully aware that passengers have no legal recourse against Delta and they did not hesitate to pass that along with a heaping serving of disdain and arrogance. During this fine example of ""Special Services"" Delta continued to be consistent with the emails telling me how sorry they were for the delay and how they care about their customers. New flight leaving 8:55 am next day. Delayed twice because the Flight attendants were reported by the gate attendant at 8:45 am as being in the airport but did not show up at the gate until after 9:30. Possibly they were in time out like the ones the day before. All in all our 6 hour flight only took 32 hrs to complete and the depths of Delta's incessantly repeated ""The most important connections we make aren't between places. They're between people"" really applies."

My husband and I were traveling to Cancun to celebrate our marriage with our friends and family. I was extremely happy with the customer service from the minute we walked up to the counter to getting our bags at the terminal. Staff were so gracious and very attentive. Big smiles and super professionals. You want to greeted like you are a valued customer no matter what seat you buy. I was impressed. We expressed how stressed out we were about one particular bag (wedding dress) making there with no issues, they assured us that it would get there and not to worry. When we got to Cancun, our bag had a priority tag. They really made us feel special. Thank you ladies for being true professionals and great at your job. We need more people like you! Moving forward I will fly Delta because of our experience. What a great experience!"

Very lousy customer service and no respect for their economy travelers. They did not assign us any seats upfront. Checked in very early online but could not pick our seat. At the airport, the Delta airline agent told me that Economy cannot pick their seats. You would need to wait and as we are boarding the plane, they assigned us the seats and we were seated at the very end of the plane where the rows do not recline back because they are positioned against the wall. This seating craziness is unheard of. You either give the passengers the first come first serve like Southwest or allow people to checking online and choose whatever is available at the time they are. On both flights of this trip they also checked in our carry on at the boarding because they say they are running out of space for carry on and the plane carry on space seemed to have available space when the plane door was closed."

Delta Air Lines said 2 months ago that they credited my account for another flight, but now, the day before, are telling me that they didn't and can't do that. So their first Customer Service representative told me false information and then they told me today to use it or lose it. Now I'm giving it away because we can't use it. I loved Delta, but now Iâ€™ve been completely lied to by them and they didnâ€™t take ownership of it. I never want to fly with Delta again because of this."

Worst customer service and airline I have ever experienced. We bought our tickets June 2018 for December 20th 2018. The flight was changed more than 6 times and eventually cancelled making us reschedule and forcing us to change plans. The non stop flight we bought was changed to a connecting flight. The first flight was 2 hours late, making us miss the connecting flight. We were told oh well and scheduled in the afternoon to our destination. We were supposed to arrive in Orlando at 6 am originally and after everything, we arrived after 6pm. They also lost our baggage. Customer service didn't accommodate, didn't give us the time of day when we expressed concerns, and when we asked for a supervisor, we waited 15 minutes and eventually walked away because they never showed up. If you can, do not fly Delta. They are awful!"

Extremely disappointed with the ground crew and maintenance of Delta in Cleveland. Had to abort flight just before we got to the end of runway due to a maintenance error that was not even clarified on. We ended up spending about 2 hours in the plane with no AC as a result. I made it to my next Delta flight destination with 3 min to spare, only to be told I canâ€™t go on the plane 100ft in front of me. It may have been a different story if the ground crew was not so lackadaisical back in Cleveland. Will not be flying Delta again."

I can't get over the fact that the flight was delayed twice leaving RDU. This is known by the airline yet zero effort is made to make connections. We made it to the gate with 10 minutes before take off. Plane at the gate and no agent around. That is the first issue. Why is no one at the gate? I have to track down an agent. They should have been waiting for at arrival. Next she speaks with the gate agent while he is closing the door. I am a customer service manager, this would not be at all acceptable in my industry. Worst ever. I feel as though the airline broke their contact and left me the passenger out in the cold."

1276,5,20,December,2018,Economy Class,Jacksonville , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,France, Trip Verified ,"  Montego Bay to Atlanta. Air France flight operated by Delta. Our flight on November 12, 2018 was planned for 4:42pm. Due to a technical issue, the plane didn't take off and another one was sent from Atlanta. The so-called ""rescue"" plane didn't take off from ATL before 8pm and we only left MBJ at 00:15 on the 13th. In consequence we spent the whole day at the airport (we arrived at 2:15pm). We weren't offered to stay in a hotel close by and I even had to ask the staff for something to eat. We landed in Atlanta around 3am and were charged a no show fee at the hotel. We also had to pay for the transport to the hotel as airport shuttles don't run at this time. AF customer service that's supposed to take care of that refused to compensate us as it is a US company operating a US flight. Doesn't matter that we booked from Air France. Is it really our problem that they delegate the flight to a partner? Even scarier: that ""technical"" issue was apparently a leak that prevented the plane to take off, however the plane just flew from ATL. So, there's no customer service but there's also no maintenance!? Cheap ass airline we will never fly again."

On this trip, I arrived on Greensboro nc to start my flight, I didnt notice until I was at the airport that my extra luggage was severely damaged (possibly from my last flight with delta), however I did not mention that to them because I didnt know if they did it or the bag was just worn. So the lady took my bag and said she would tape it and send it to St Louis, my final arriving spot. After leaving Atlanta and getting to St louis, they had my bag beside the claims department, no surprise because I had a stop in Atlanta. When I told them I was picking the bag up they wheeled out a brand new luggage with tags on it of 160.00 and said Merry Christmas, we want you to travel safely next time. I was in shock, o had never said a word to them about my bag. Not only did it make my day and Christmas, it totally turned my neutral thoughts on Delta, and they made a customer that will continue to use them, and I will not forget what they did for me. Thank you Delta for a kind and generous act."

My family and I experienced unprofessional customer service by the flight attendants of this flight. My family and I had a very rough ten hour trip on our first flight since we had a connecting flight from AeroMexico to Atlanta. We did not expect this type of treatment. During the one hour flight from Atlanta to Houston we experienced behavior that consisted of loud conversations in the back of the plane and rude responses when ask to be attended. By rude responses we would be answered with words such as ""cool"" and ""move"". At some point my family and I didn't even want to be approach by them, that's the kind of discomfort we felt to display towards them. The pilot on the other hand gave us a smooth flight and accommodation. "

An employee at Santa Ana Airport Delta check-in whose rudeness and customer service were to a point that is ridiculous and unacceptable. She rudely explained to me they had to check every higher class guests before me, so I kept waiting. A while later a third employee came out (now there were 3 lines) and signaled me to come up. Not longer than four seconds after I came up, the other agent proceeded to cut off our conversation and almost yelled at my face, ""I already told you many times we have to help all higher class guests before you, why do you keep asking."" And let's not mention customer service yet, even on the normal basis, politeness between two humans, she does not have! A customer does not deserve basic polite interaction between humans, because of economy class? Thanks very much Delta, I will most likely not fly with you again to avoid headaches like this."

It was about 7 hours flight. A comfortable one - Staff was nice and courteous - food (AVML) was good, well the choice could have been better but then it is all personal - and most of the facilities including entertainment were also good. The seat spacing was okay but then you have to adjust somewhere when you travel economy. Checkin facilities were also up to the mark. On the whole the experience was good."

Cabin crew was professional and friendly. Pilots provided flight info and alerted passengers when turbulence was expected. The flight attendants handed out a printed flight schedule and menu outlining when services would be provided and they followed through on this. Lunch had three options, mid flight snack was a warm chocolate chip cookie and two options for pre-arrival snack. During the flight, the attendants came through three or four times to offer water. At the end of the flight, flight attendants came through the main cabin thanking passengers for flying Delta and handing out candy. The experience was very nice and a cut above the Air France flight we had from FRA to CDG to connect with this flight. In-flight experience noticeably better than other legacy carriers I have flown in the past year. The flights to FRA (RDU-DTW then DTW-FRA) were also good. Delta has a new safety video which also presents a very positive image about travel and connecting with family and friends and is very nice to see."

1284,2,10,December,2018,Economy Class,Richmond , Cancun , Atlanta      ,Couple Leisure,France, Trip Verified ,"  We split our time between France and US. So we fly quite often between the two, and we also travel a lot for leisure. So we decided to use around the world tickets, the advantage being it allows you to make stops, change flight schedules etc. without penalties. Additionally, we opted to go Business class with 1st class flights with the latter being carriers who do not have business class. There is an unspoken expectation that if you upgrade, you will be allowed to use the lounge. Long story short, wrong. We flew from Paris to Detroit. Stopped in Detroit, MI for a few days, then flew to Reno, NV. We were able to use the business lounge in Paris, but not able to use the business lounge in Detroit, stating that we could only use it if we continue on to Reno on the same day. Or basically flying continuously around the world? WTF? I am not trying to be entitled or ask for special treatment, but when you pay for business or first class tickets, there is an expectation that you can use the lounges. So I tweeted to Delta and they asked me to PM them with my complaint/feedback. Response I got, itâ€™s basically their policy, and theyâ€™re not making exceptions. Again, I was not asking for special treatment nor do I feel as though I am entitled, but there is an expectation when you pay 3-times that of economy. I write this to let otherâ€™s know, because you have choices for around the world tickets. I like flying business because, call it paranoia, but I like being at the airport early so as not to miss my flight, and having the comfort of these lounges. Delta really needs to look at their â€œaround the world policyâ€ as it relates to usage of their lounge. This is the response I got from Delta. â€œThanks for your patience, Randy. I have further reviewed policies and we strongly enforce these guidelines. Please know we regret the disappointment as we value your business and choice of airline. Applying for the Delta American Express Card or buying a Membership is also another option. You can find further details on the link I provided for you earlier. *ASTâ€ If using lounges is important to you, then please check the individual airlines policies first."

My wife suggested this forum. I have flown all over the world and there are always small problems. This was different. This airline flew me to my destination and then back to Seattle without any explanations. No offer of hotel or accommodations. Just a long stay in the airport with a ""too bad, so sad attitude by staff"". Also destroyed my luggage in such a way to completely remove an entire corner. I will never ever use this airline again.

Our plane from Idaho landed at 8:15 and I made a mad dash across multiple terminals and arrived at my gate at 8:21. The plane door was still open and I saw the last few people enter the plane and the attendant said I was too late. In short. The flight attendant saw me, ignored me and was very rude when I approached her. She made no effort to accommodate me and simply scheduled me for a flight arriving at almost midnight.

1293,1,28,November,2018,Economy Class,Oakland , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," This airline severely mishandled the winter storm that came in. For starters, a message notifying of my delayed flight was not sent until I was on my way to the airport, a trip about 1.5 hours with the road conditions. I arrived about 1.5 hours before my flight departed, so this was less than a 3 hour window. About half way to the airport, I was notified of a 2 hour delay. This was understandable given the conditions. However, Delta kept pushing back the flight at that point in 1 and 0.5 hour increments all the way until 5:40. In this time, all I could do was wait. While Delta did provide food for the many people waiting, it certainly was not very good (cheap pizza and water) and not enough for everyone. They even ran out of plates for people. Finally, when the plane arrived, the passengers were told that the crew could no longer work, and we were forced to wait another 3.5 hours while they tried to find a crew. Given they knew about this storm and the delay, they should have been aware of the crew's inability to work more hours and have a standby crew ready. After finally boarding the plane at 9pm, almost 12 hours after arriving at the airport, the passengers learned we still didn't have a co-pilot and were forced to wait another 1.5 hours. Even after finally landing it took an additional 10 minutes than normal because there were problems getting the hallway for people to get off to work. Overall these delays cost me over 13 hours, and I missed a class and a fairly important meeting. This management is inexcusable by an airline, and now I know to avoid flying Delta when possible."

I am currently sitting in the chairs of the airport, having spent 9 hours already for what was supposed to be 3-4 hours journey, and it will be 12 hours more until I am finally home.

I am so angry; why do you offer insurance if it does not protect your trip? Mexico is very unsafe right now, and we donâ€™t feel comfortable going anymore, but they will do absolutely nothing for us, not even change the flight to a different location. Not to mention, we fly quite often and 9 times out of 10 Deltaâ€™s planes are ALWAYS delayed!

It was later delayed again which would result in us missing our connection in LAX to HNL. We were told to proceed to Delta Operations and they would arrange flights for us to HNL. They arranged a flight to SFO on DELTA and a flight from SFO to HNL with Alaska Airlines. In the end we arrived on time as originally scheduled. However my bag did not arrive. The baggage attendant in HNL took all the necessary documentation required for missing luggage and advised that it would arrive the following day. She advised that we could purchase items that I would require in the interim. My luggage did arrive late the following evening 3rd Oct. Delta reimbursed us for the Comfort seating which we had purchased along with the late luggage, in a very timely manner. We will no doubt fly with Delta again as they took care of us. The lady at Delta Operations was very nice for being under a great deal of pressure from a number of other passengers on the same cancelled flight."
1301,1,21,November,2018,Economy Class,Panama City , Dublin , Atlanta / Amsterdam    ,Solo Leisure,Singapore, Trip Verified ,"  I recently flew from Minneapolis to Singapore with Delta. Mistakes happen in life, and this time Delta made a (from my understanding) fairly rare error resulting in my luggage being lost for a month. I realize this happens from time to, but expect when it does for it to be handled professionally. I have never seen such inadequate and unprofessional management of what one would assume to be a simple situation. Repeatedly my Delta agent simply ignored my requests for information related what Delta was offering to cover and what they were denyingâ€”I still have no idea what exactly is being covered. Furthermore, the agent ignored my requests for a phone call--when she final addressed the request she said the time difference was too great despite my offering to take the call at any time no matter how inconvenient it was for me. I had to drive the entire conversation with the agent frequently taking over a week to get back to me even after multiple follow-up emails from my end. I spent about 15 hours of my own time handling this situation and in the end Delta provided me with a $250 voucher for the $2,000+ ticket and is covering 75% of my cost and the damage to my personal things. If Delta actively employees a strategy of confusion and incompetence to reduce costs, they nailed this case."

I had a pleasant trip flying into NYC but I tried extending my trip and the customer service rep and supervisor couldn't help me. Even though I was willing to pay more to push back my flight they were not helpful at all. I understand I didnt click a certain button when I bought the ticket but I wasn't aware I couldn't move my flight for that reason alone. How is Delta suppose to keep my business if they aren't willing to help a first time flyer. I will not be flying with them again due to this. Customer service is to help not to deny. Especially when I want asking for the end of the world. I'm pretty sure the supervisor could have helped me but her instant ""NO"" was very rude and unnecessary especially when I'm sure she could override the system. Lost a customer due to that."

Couldn't believe the difference between Delta One published pictures of the seat area and the real thing! It was really small. I felt crunched in Seat 1A. The lay flat seat was not very comfortable. Flight Attendants looked really good in their new pink outfits, and they seemed ok, but a little distant. Food was horrible -I had some kind of chicken ""blob"" with a mashed ""sweet potato"". The IFE was severely lacking with only about 18 movies offered, and the screen was tiny. Compare this to Philippine Airlines with approximately 100 movies available."

I bought mine and my son tickets together. I've never been separated from anyone I've flown with. He is 13 yrs old with severe anxiety issues. I'm told they have no seats to put us together and I've spent the last 30 mins trying to call him down. I don't care if he is old enough in your terms to fly alone. Mentally he is not! I have never been so unhappy with an airline. This is unacceptable in my book! I wouldn't recommend anyone flying with children that they consider old enough to fly on their own with any type of disability or concerns with their mental health to fly this airline!

Spend extra money to avoid flying with them. During my most recent trip, all three of my flights were delayed. One was on account of weather, which was not Deltaâ€™s fault. Telling me and everyone else with connecting flights that we had been â€œrebookedâ€ when in fact we had not was certainly deltaâ€™s fault. They did this for the other two delays that were undoubtedly deltaâ€™s doing and had nothing to do with weather. Each leg involved hours upon hours of trying to find a delta phone operator who felt like rebooking my flight. When I finally made it to my destination, I was informed that delta had sent my bags (which would have come in handy for my two-week vacation) the opposite direction all the way back to Detroit. No airport nor telephone staff could divine the location of my bags for about two days. Really consider avoiding Delta at all costs, even if itâ€™s domestic"

Because it was a different airline that was causing me to miss my Delta flight, I was worried that Delta would make me buy a new ticket to get home. I contacted them via Twitter and ended up messaging with someone who was extremely helpful and put me on the next flight from Baltimore no questions asked. Iâ€™m very thankful for the simplicity and ease Delta provided by putting me on a new flight."

Just had the worst travel experience of my 50 years on delta. Flight supposed to leave at 6 am and repeatedly delayed until now scheduled to leave at 8:30 pm. Gate attendants gave few updates and the ones they gave were misrepresentations. Most recently, they said flight was pulling up to gate and would board at 3:30 but then 2 minutes later delayed another 4 hours. Because of the misleading information provided all day we missed the opportunity to book on other flights and so incurred significant losses in hotels and other travel costs. When I asked for compensation they offered to reimburse the flight and give me $100. This does not even cover my actual out of pocket financial loss much less the inconvenience and mistreatment."

Iâ€™ve had nothing but issues with them every single time Iâ€™ve flown with this airline. At STT, the Delta crew were all on extended break and took their own time to show up to finally start checking bags. Once the flight arrived at JFK, it took an hour to make it to the gate. We kept being told â€œ5-10 minsâ€. Then we find out our connecting flight had been cancelled. Delta felt they did us a favor by rebooking a flight for us- that went out the following day - late evening - with another layover. After several errors on Deltaâ€™s customer service to book us a better flight- we finally thought we were on our way home after 6 hours - for that flight to also keep getting delayed. All Delta flights were extremely delayed. Some because they were â€œwaiting on the flight crew to arriveâ€. This airline doesnâ€™t even attempt to accommodate considerably or appropriately for their negligence or error. Iâ€™ve always had the worst experiences with Delta and we will not allow them another chance. Other airlines seem to have more helpful employees and operate much more smoothly - making their airlines much more dependable"

Shockingly awful experience and further validation why I try to avoid Delta. Booked a flight to make a birthday 75th birthday dinner for my dad. My first flight (Delta) was delayed significantly by 1.5+ hours. When we landed at the connecting terminal, Detroit, I asked the flight attendant to let the second flight (also Delta) know we arrived as we had 10 minutes until takeoff. She shrugged and said it would be fine and to run. I and several other passengers ran to the gate for the second flight and the airplane was gated but we werenâ€™t allowed on it. See below pictures of the airplane at the gate that everyone on the first flight was denied entry. I could not make the birthday dinner party with the other flight offered and asked for a refund and to be returned home. I was told I would not be refunded and to go home I would need to purchase another ticket. Absolutely shocking! Delta: 1) did not communicate with itself about the connecting flight being delayed. 2) when explicitly asked to notify the gate refused to do so. 3) when I asked to go home and be refunded was told I had to buy my own ticket home and no refund so it is cheaper for me to sit here in the airport, fly to St. Louis, then fly back to Toronto."

Worst most disrespectful treatment by gate/ground staff I've ever had in a airline anywhere. Suffice it to say the following that occurred to us, a family who was on a trip that we saved thousands for with a terminally ill family member trying to make memories To have it ruined at the last minute and have bad memories of it is extremely unacceptable.  First was called by Delta the partner in the flight with KLM, called and told us they were changing our flight with a 24 hr lay over ""as crew couldn't find a place to stay for the night in Panama City due to the storm"". Never mind that we looked up and found several places on the beach. In any event, this meant we would have to add another day of expense and change our flights to 5:55 AM, meaning we also lost all ability to submit our VAT refunds among other things, but the worst was yet to come. On checking in the 'lady' at the gate told us we could not carry on our policy size and weight carry on bags, as the ""flight was full"", yet the bags had important medical equipment, medicines and fragile expensive goods that we had no ability to lock up as we were told the bags would be able to be carried on. If the bags were lost or damaged replacing the equipment and meds would be extremely hard even once back home. The worst part-every other passenger behind us and at other gates for the same flight were being allowed to carry on their bags as advertised. CWhen confronted about why this was the case the gate attendant told us ""call direct if you like its in the policy fine print, we can do this to you"" She then became belligerent and gave one word answers, didnt look at us and said 'next"". When I tried to ask if wheelchair assistance had been confirmed, she spouted off a series of gate numbers where I could go ask for a wheelchair, and rushed us out of line. I then returned to the gate as her info wasn't sufficient, and asked another gate attendant who simply stuck her finger in the air and said ""over there somewhere"" and didn't even look at us.  Wheelchair assistance either wasn't at the gates or was very late and we had short connect flights and couldn't just hope it showed up. My son and wife  had to almost carry me at a run to the next gate. The only connection this didn't happen at was Atlanta and then only because we we hunted down a wheelchair attendant when ours wasn't there. The gate attendants were disrespectful, dismissive, and left us genuinely concerned given my inability to walk the distances due to legitimate neurological disease for which I carried medical proof- They forced us to check bags that others were carrying on board -passengers of the same ticket class as us. In fact nearly every other passenger boarding had their bags, The only difference in us and other passengers. -we had a disabled passenger. Thanks KLM for taking what should have been a good memory for our family with thousands of dollars of expense and sending my family home stressed, insulted, worried and upset. Never again."

My flight was delayed until me the next day and they kept on canceling our flight until we were told there was a 12 am flight. I waited only for the flight to be canceled due to excessive flight hours by the crew. It was impossible that they did not know this when they told us that a 12 am flight from LAX was coming. I injured my left toe due to the chaos by other passengers catching the hotel shuttle and today I received a message from the Delta Customer Service that it was an unfortunate incident and I cannot be compensated when that was not even what I was asking for! The crew the next day said they were waiting for notification from Delta and were told that the flight was canceled and the crew verified that they did not work excessive hours!! Imagine our disappointment. I just think that the blatant disregard by Delta about their passengers is deplorable. No compassion. Total dishonesty. Just disappointing. Useless upgrade.

My internet didnâ€™t work on flight 1532. The seats are smaller than Southwest and American. And the beverage service was slow. By the time I got my drink we were almost landed.

She even let me board early to clean my 3 year olds area to prevent any reaction to the peanuts. She also told me that I would have nothing to worry about and they wouldnâ€™t serve peanuts on the plane. I even told the flight attendants as I got on the plane. But, as the flight attendants are coming by with snacks I over heard her ask the lady across from me if she wanted peanuts. I then asked her if she was serving them. She turned red and realized she messed up. Peanut allergies are very serious. She came back and told me they would give me a 25 dollar Visa card to come to my email for the inconvenience.

That makes a perfect trifecta for the year, London, Paris and Narita/Singapore. All with run down 767's, full of flat hard cushions, broken USB ports, glitchy touch screens that take you 15 minutes to select a movie. Last week they only had enough meals for half of coach. They blamed it on the contractor who provides the meals, although it could have been caught if they had checked it. Their inability to board a flight on time probably precludes the Flight Attendants from being able to double check the ""Contractors"". Thank goodness for their partner airlines, like KLM, they have newer planes, and are much more pleasant to fly. I see no value in being a Diamond Medallion on Delta Airlines.

1328,1,4,November,2018,Economy Class,Boston , Bemidji , Minneapolis      ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ," I always have mixed feelings about Delta's 767-300ER. It (and 767 in general) has the best economy seating arrangement of 2-3-2. However, the aircraft is loud and the overhead bins are small. IFE on this particular aircraft was good, with a nice selection of movies (this has been my positive impression about Delta). Food and service were decent, as expected from the airline. My flight was diverted due to bad weather in NYC (sounds familiar?), and this, of course, was not the airline's fault. In fact, the crew did a good job updating us about status and showed effort to get us to JFK as fast as they could."
1329,1,3,November,2018,Economy Class,Seattle , Amsterdam        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  New York JFK to Frankfurt. When I left the Sky Club in JFK terminal 4 and headed to the nearby gate roughly 10 minutes before boarding, I got a text from Delta that the departure gate was changed. It was a non-issue unless the new gate was in terminal 2, and the only way to get there was by bus. To make things more confusing, the text did not advise me where I could take the bus, which departed from another gate. When I made to T2, an old, small and overcrowding facility, the flight was delayed because they needed to transfer the food, which had already been loaded to the original aircraft at the original gate, to the new aircraft (?). I ended up arriving at Frankfurt late, and the delay was not caused by weather or any technical issue. Reading many reviews here, one can easily notice that many complains about US carriers are about delays and how the airlines handle the situation, and that was what exactly happened here with Delta. The 767 perhaps has the best economy class seating arrangement, with only 1 per row that is not either a window or an aisle seat. The 767-400 used for my flight had the old version of IFE which was not that great (Delta's 767-300ER had better, newer IFE). I paid for wifi (the free version never works) and it worked fine. Service and food were fine. Crew distributed bottle water after meal (without us asking) which I think was a nice touch for us to stay hydrated throughout the flight. Overall, without the ground service issue, Delta is a pleasant airline to fly with."

There were a few snack choices, and the plane ride was smooth. It was a bit more expensive than AA, but I'd use Delta again for these reasons! Secondary flight was a few minutes delayed, but that's understandable (there was bad weather in ATL.)

I discovered this when we landed and I realized my phone was missing. The Flight Attendant explained that he'd given it to the Gate Attendant back in Atlanta, and even provided her name.

I was assured by the lady who checks in bags that Iâ€™d be able to call after my trip and get my refund. I was not able to do this when I called in. They said that according to their systems I had apparently checked in a bag. This was incorrect. They then attempted to hand me off to their baggage handling service line to get more baggage history. Shouldnâ€™t getting their things together correctly be their job? The flight itself was horrible. I checked in a day early to ensure me and my fiancÃ© had seats together and when the actual flight came they tried to switch my seat without asking me or even telling me that my seat had changed.

After begrudgingly taking our drink orders in first class the beverages were slammed on our trays without a please or thank you. This is a 5.5 hour flight and for most of it the FA was nowhere to be seen. We finally found her sitting in a comfort seat in 17A.

Even after telling then that we had no service in 1st class I was just given a ""oh sorry"" which did me no good. The FA further was unable to give the correct coats (from coat check) back to the proper passengers because it would have required her actually labeling them or tracking them. This woman clearly did not want to do her job. She works in the wrong industry and gives Delta a bad name. She was based out of LA and had the attitude to go with it. Horrible service!"

First leg of the outbound was delayed on the tarmac due to flow control into Delta's Minneapolis hub, where I was to transfer. Apparently this is not uncommon, so one wonders if the airline should adjust its schedule accordingly -- perhaps by disallowing short layovers -- which is the reason for an imperfect score. I arrived at MSP about 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. The Delta app said my gate was a 12-minute walk. However, I'd gate-checked my bag, so I was still in jeopardy of missing the connection. When I stepped off the plane I was met in the jetway by a Delta staffer who solved all my problems by escorting me to a car on the tarmac, where we grabbed my bag from the baggage handler, and shot off through a tunnel under the C and G concourses, directly to my connection. I had 10-15 minutes to spare. To top off this good experience, the Asian vegetarian meal they served was restaurant-quality -- delicious and healthy. Good job, Delta.

Every experience Iâ€™ve had with Delta has been frustrating. This last trip had us running over a mile through the Minneapolis airport for a connecting flight that should have been next-door gates. Literally not a single other plane in the airport for our 9:30 pm board time and of course our first flight was late. It was only a few minutes and still the scheduling was so bad that we had to have our next flight held as we ran toward it.

The food in the Economy was better than in the business class. In the Business Class I had ravioli which was dry with a very chemical tasting kind of sauce. Afterwards I had an ice cream which I returned as well as it did not taste like vanille but like chemicals. The next meal, ""breakfast"" was cereals (too sweet) or a tortilla. I desided to take the tortilla. However, that was something made of egg powder. It was just horrible. One pays a lot to travel business class, for that money I at least expect a tasty meal. Also the personnel on my way in economy were much friendlier than the attendents in the business class who were arrogant and not very friendly. All together I will never fly Delta business class anymore!"

I don't know how people, particularly anyone over 6 feet tall, routinely fly on Delta. Their jets have the worstâ€”leastâ€”amount of legroom of any airline I've flown. I'm 6'4"" with long legs, and the seat I was in had just enough space behind the seat in front of it to allow me to wedge my legs into the space, but I could not move them side to side because of the people beside me. Consequently, I had to sit for 2 hours with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me, with all the obvious discomfort you can imagine. Luckily, the lady in front of me did not recline her seat. That would have been an even greater amount of pain. Seriously, why does Delta pack these seats so closely together? Do they not realize there are people out there taller than 5-1/2 feet? They should make one-third of the rows with larger leg room, and reserve these seats for people of a minimum height. Delta is my last resort for flying, and the only reason I had to settle for this flight was it was the only direct flight option for me. I guess I should stick to American and just accept the added hassle of connecting flights and layovers just to get a more comfortable ride. Come on, Delta!"

My family exclusively flies with Southwest but they donâ€™t fly to Knoxville. So we took a chance on Delta. Mistake. First I was separated from my 2 yo and had to spend an hour on the phone with a service rep to change our seats. Then our flight to Atlanta was delayed and we were going to miss our connection. We were told to call the rescheduling number. When we did, it took talking to a supervisor to get rescheduled. We spent 6 hrs in the airport with an upset 2 year old. And as of now we still have not boarded our new flight. In the future I will either fly southwest or drive. I will never take another flight on Delta."

By â€œconsistentâ€ I mean that my husband and I witnessed two different families receive upgrades/flight changes under exceptional circumstances, yet when we asked, at the gate, to board a non-full flight that would allow us to arrive home six hours earlier, we were vehemently denied. Denied when we checked in, denied when we spoke to the crew at our layover stop, and denied by customer service on the phone; and that was just the state-side experience. When on our international leg, our flight was originally overbooked; we went out of our way to volunteer for a later flight. The itinerary was lined up and at the last second, the staff decided they did NOT need us to switch. So there we were, having gone to the trouble of adjusting our arrival plans, only to rush to re-arrange them in the five minutes before we took off for the states. Funny how they had no trouble adjusting our itinerary twice for their own needs. As I write this, that homebound flight is leaving, with empty seats, and two fully dissatisfied customers sitting in the lobby who will forevermore go out of their way to fly anything but Delta."

I show up to PDX at 3:00am to check in for a 6:00am departure (Iâ€™m an early bird). I wait until 4:30am and ask when Delta reps are supposed to be out. That was supposed to happen at 4am. So, thatâ€™s strike one. Not out until 4:45am where thereâ€™s a line of at least 30 people. First flight to SLC was fine. The flight staff I liked, they were the only ones I liked. Super short layover at SLC. Get on at SLC, the new staff made a big deal about a pet and made sure I knew not to remove the dog from the crate.  Land at RDU, have maybe 20 minutes to deliver a puppy, check in, and go through TSA. Oh wait, I am â€œtoo lateâ€ because I was on the plane for the last four hours and didnâ€™t check in at least an hour in advance and my seat was given away. I had no way of checking in when phone barely receives iMessage on the free WiFi. So I get a â€œseat requestâ€ and am told if Iâ€™m not fast enough that Iâ€™ll have to come back out and buy a new ticket. Strike two. After TSA, I sprint to my gate where I have seconds to spare. Luckily I have a seat left. During that flight is what sealed the deal. They offer flight fuel and meals. I wanted a specific one, I was given something else. Ok, I can deal. When the flight attendants come back to collect trash and recyclables, they never took mine. Keep in mind, this is the same staff that flew from SLC to RDU, now theyâ€™re serving in the return flight. They wouldnâ€™t refill my water. Basically refusing service, and Iâ€™m suffering from nausea (all flights prior were rough), dehydration, and exhaustion. Thatâ€™s not ok. They picked and chose who to serve. I had to leave my garbage in my seat upon landing because they wouldnâ€™t take it. I was happy to get to SLC where Delta staff had better attitudes. The flight from SLC to PDX was better. I slept. I was woken up by the landing. I was happy to be off the plane. My recommendation for Delta is nonexistent. I wouldnâ€™t recommend them to my worst enemy. Who ever was working that flight from SLC to RDU, and returning, you displayed very poor customer service. I wasnâ€™t the only one to notice. They act as if theyâ€™re better than everyone. Alaska is cheaper quality, but their staff is top notch and service is stellar."

Let start with my ticket: it's a round-trip ticket from Binghampton to New Orleans and versa. The flight from Binghamton --> New Orleans was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-5 Then, this was how it happened. My first flight was delayed for 1h30min, and of course, I missed my connecting flight. I have to stay in a hotel overnight in Detroit. I don't have much time with my family this trip, and now I have to spend 1 night in the middle of nowhere. I was really mad with them, they gave me a voucher $100, and at least I felt they care about my feeling. At that point, I can rate them 4 stars. The flight was delayed, but the reaction was good. The flight from New Orleans --> Binghamton was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-10. Again, the first flight was delayed for ""2 hours"". And again, I have to stay in Detroit 1 more night. I can't imagine how my trip 5 days with 4 days with my family turned into 6 days with 3 days at home. I contacted them about my issue, now the attitude was changed, they thought that they gave me $100 voucher and it's done. I deserve to have the delay one more time ""on the same trip"". They sent me to a hotel name Travelodge, it's a very very bad hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 11:30PM and hadn't had dinner yet. I was thirsty and need some water. Since I don't have cash with me so I ask the help desk at the hotel for some water. After I said I don't have cash, she told me to drink water in the bathroom, ""it's OK!"".  Now the wifi doesn't work, but I have to write this because I am really mad now. The lesson is: you may have a fault, but the way you fix it is more important. For the person who thought that $100 voucher is big, and it's ok to wait 2 nights for 2 delays on the same trip, I'm ashamed of you, you are so cheap! Thanks ""Delay"" Airline for a wonderful flight!"

Twenty minutes into the flight (after her and another stewardess sat back and gossiped) they began to serve passengers off of the beverage cart. After serving 3 quarters of the passengers, the attendant said ""Sorry, we are done."" I asked for a water and she said ""No, pilot's orders."" She later came by and asked if we had any trash to which I responded ""How could we, you didn't offer us anything?"" She asked if I was upset and I told her that I was because I just needed some water as I had traveled all day. She said to take it up with the pilot. At this point we still had half an hour until landing. Also, there was no turbulence. My Delta flier miles card is going bye-bye. You don't treat people like that."

Delta used to be one of the best airlines apart from Alaska, they used to take customer service seriously. I havenâ€™t flown much in the last several years but due to work I am beginning to travel on a weekly basis. Delta has obviously gone downhill in the last several years. Not putting families together when flying, not able to assist with seat changes to accommodate families, and this entire process change. This will be my very last flight with this company.

When I arrived home, my bags didn't make it. I went to the Delta baggage office, and the clerk simply stated they were checked in late, they would be on the next flight and I could come back and get them. No apologies no nothing.

I was flying standby and my flight was originally supposed to be at 1154am. I was bumped off of 6 flights because of availability. It was time for the last flight out and I was very nervous. They called my name to board the plane and I was very relieved. I got settled on the plane and started reading my book. All of a sudden the flight attendant called my name and another gentlemanâ€™s name. Right before the plane was getting ready to take off they told both of us that we had to give up our seats. This was one of the most degrading experiences of my life! The supervisor made us get off the plane and give up our seats. The other person working for the airline told me she wasnâ€™t supposed to do that because the people didnâ€™t arrive until the plane was about to leave. This was the same supervisor that told me to board the plane. The supervisor showed no remorse whatsoever. I'd been at the airport since 930 am and now Iâ€™m going to miss work and not be able to get home to my pets! One of the delta employees that was working one of the flights I was bumped off earlier told me that the airport had an agreement with the local hotels for discounted rates for people that were displaced because of issues with flights. The supervisor told me that she was the only person I could speak with about my issue. She also didnâ€™t mention the discounted hotel rates until I brought it up and the rates she told me were twice the amount of what the previous employee said. I understand that you arenâ€™t guaranteed a seat flying standby but they shouldnâ€™t treat people like theyâ€™re inferior. I also understand that people make mistakes but good companies do their best to rectify them. The supervisor I dealt with did the least she could to help me with this situation.

She apparently tagged my bag according to my seat number, and no receipt of this was given to me. When i disembarked the flight, while awaiting the baggage there is no sign of the bag. No one from Delta can give me any answers. It seems to be 'lost' or so im told. I have made numerous calls to the agents and i keep being told they are searching for the bag as there are many bags from Delta which are untagged.  I am currently miles away from home on a holiday which i saved up for a long time, the agents tell me to go ahead and purchase whatever needs to be replaced from the bag, then i am told it will take 4 weeks for the claim to be processed and there is no guarantee it will be fully reimbursed!"

Then when we started boarding the gate attendant insisted that I tucked my 2inch x 4inch clutch inside my bag because it is the third bag. Then we proceed on to the plane and noticed that due to runway conflict we are now going to wait for another 40mins inside the airplane. Or at least that is the minimum estimate of wait wait time.

I was flying from Boston to Greensboro, NC for a job interview on Friday when the hurricane is supposed to hit the region. My employer canceled the interview, but since they did not cancel the flight, I was told that this is voluntary change that I am making. Additionally, I had to fly before September 20th, since the ""bulletin"" board mentioned that is the law. 2 flaws in these statements: A bulletin board cannot determine that my flight needs to be on a certain date because that is when my employer wants to interview. I would love to fly before September 20th, but I cannot do that- that is impossible from my employer's perspective.  When it is supposed to rain 20 inches and since you have not canceled the flight, does not mean that flight will not fly. Just because you dont cancel the flight does not mean that the hazard of the hurricane goes away. Extremely rude customer representatives who would argue with me about my own thought process, would not let me finish the sentence and would keep on going on and on about this supposed bulletin board that is their law.

1371,2,7,September,2018,First Class,New York , Tampa       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  My family just traveled from Ft. Myers to Atlanta round trip on Delta. We purchased 5 economy tickets for 2 adults and 3 children. When we checked in for the first flight to ATL the counter personnel made a snide comment about our tickets being basic economy and how lucky we were to have seats in the same row. For this first leg we had 5 seats in row 40 with 1 other passenger between us. That was good and we had a fine flight. When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty. No other airline has embarrassed me or belittled me for choosing to fly economy with them. Bottom line is, if you buy a published basic economy fare on Delta Airlines, be prepared to be admonished and treated like you don't deserve to be on their plane."
1372,1,7,September,2018,Economy Class,Detroit , Montreal        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  I booked a first class trip for two on Delta Airlines using my Delta Sky-miles Platinum Card. We were flying from La Guardia to Houston. Itâ€™s about a four hour flight. For me, any flight over two hours I tend to fly first class. Unless, the ticket value is exceptional. Although Iâ€™ve held this card for sometime now, Iâ€™ve only flown first class twice on Delta. I generally use Delta to fly to Atlanta, which is approximately two hours. Anyway, the trip began with the rep at the gate informing us that we wouldnâ€™t be able to sit together due to a broken seat. I was like that blows but whatever. Then I thought to ask the Delta Rep if maybe they could simply inquire with the passenger; who one of would be sat next to, if they didnâ€™t mind switching to a different seat (still in first class but with no on occupying the seat next to it). I was told by the Delta Rep, that I should do it myself. Which, if thatâ€™s their policy, I get! He offered no other remedy. Maybe he couldâ€™ve said: hey, I realize itâ€™s a bit of an inconvenience, separating you and if itâ€™s important for you to be seated together; I could move you but youâ€™d be losing first class service (which is much on Delta anyway). I just felt that there was no regard for professionalism. It matter of fact and deal with it attitude. The kicker was this, we boarded the plane and the â€œfirst classâ€ Stewardess was no prize either. I will give this though, she did assist in getting us seated together. She then took drink and food orders. My order was taken first. Apparently, too many people ordered the chicken salad dish. She came back to me and hereâ€™s the dialogue: I canâ€™t give you the chicken dish, youâ€™ll have to have the pastrami sandwich. I said well Iâ€™ll pass, because I donâ€™t eat pastrami. But how does that work anyway, you told me my choices and I selected like everyone else? She says we ran out of the chicken. I say, but you took my order first? She says well in looking at the medallion status, you fall to the bottom. What was so crazy about that is that I purchased both first class tickets and she brings my boyfriend the chicken salad! We both laughed like hell! Again, to her defense it could only be the Delta Airline to blame. No ideal how she decided he got to eat over me though. There is clearly no  training on tact or etiquette. And if Iâ€™m wrong in that statement; there is either no policy in place for common occurrences. The whole point of this review is to hopefully save anyone from wasting money on Delta first class. Iâ€™ve flown first class on American Airlines quite a few times also and have had zero complaints. Their planes even appear to be nicer. The meal thing wouldn't happen either as you select it 30 days to 24 hours before your flight. Iâ€™ll be getting rid of the Delta card. It serves no purpose."

I paid for a very expensive ticket and I was treated very unfair. I was given no respect and was given no attention as a customer.  I was seated twice on the plane and both times had to leave the plane because of some excuses. First they said the plane had some mechanical issues, then they said the pilot had just came from a 10 hour flight and was tired. Then they said we couldnâ€™t leave because of bad weather, which was a complete cover up for everything else. I spent more than 24 hours at the airport and even had to sleep on the floor. I was disgusted by the treatment, attention, care, and service of Delta!"

Not informed 7.30pm flight was cancelled until arrival at JFK from an overseas flight. Cancellation was allegedly a result of poor weather (weather in NYC and Chicago were fine). Rebooked on next day midday as ""there were no more first class seats on the 8.30am flight"". No hotel accommodation or food was arranged and Delta Sky Priority staff at counter told that there would be no reimbursement because the flight cancellation was due to ""poor weather"".

The first part of the trip was ok but unfortunately I can't say the same about the NY-Berlin portion. The flight was delayed in more than one hour and when I got to Berlin I found out my luggage had been lost. I didn't receive any support from Delta, instructions on what to do, if they were trying to track my luggage, anything. Everything I had was on my dispatched luggage, I had nothing but my passport, wallet and camera on me. When I complained about not getting any support from them, an employee gave me a toiletry kit with a small tooth brush and some shaving cream and sent me to the lost and found area of Tegel airport. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I was told there was nothing they could do and I should fill out a form online with my personal information and if they found my bag, they would contact me. When I tried to talk to Delta employees again, I discovered there were none at the airport anymore (it was 3 pm) and there was no one at the airport I could talk about my situation. On the following day, I returned to the airport to try to solve the situation with a Delta employee and I was told my luggage had arrived on the flight from New York that was landing at that time but they couldn't hand me my bag because it had to go through customs. After that, I kept receiving emails saying my luggage was still lost and couldn't be tracked and I should be patient. My luggage was only delivered on Wednesday of the following week. At any point I was not contacted by Delta airlines with instructions, received any support or voucher to pay for the extra expenses I had to have or even an apology note. Having spent half of my time in Berlin without my luggage seriously impacted my time there as I was always concerned that my luggage might be delivered while I was out of the house. I didn't stay at a hotel and the building didn't have a doorman and no one would be there to pick it up. I was worried about not having my things back at all as I kept getting emails saying they had no idea where my luggage was, was always uncomfortable from wearing clothes borrowed from friends and generally just stressed out by the lack of care toward me from Delta."

Hurricane Lane was on its way to Hawaii. While all other airlines cancelled all flights, Delta saw it was safe to still fly in and out a little longer until the bad weather hit. The storm was about to hit us so Delta moved up the departure time about 20 minutes so we could make it out safely. We made it out of there with no complications, barely even any turbulence. We wouldâ€™ve been stuck there for days if they didnâ€™t go the extra mile to get us out of there."

Except when one decided it was ok to tell me that Iâ€™d be much prettier if I didnâ€™t have on my beanie hat. But I degress. My sole complaint is about every single solitary employee I came in contact with whether at ticketing or the gate. All of them were unwelcoming, stood with a sour look on their face, had a lack of personality and enthusiasm for their jobs, didnâ€™t make customers feel appreciated and made me feel like I was bothering them if I asked them a question. Whew! From someone who is in the hospitality industry and understands the importance of customer service, Delta receives a big fat F! The initial contact with a company is everything and if I was a person of authority within this organization, Iâ€™d perform a complete retraining on all front desk staff. In the future, Iâ€™ll ask my corporate office to book me on another airline."

I was supposed to be rebooked on this flight due to an AA flight being extremely delayed because of weather. AA was extremely helpful and friendly while getting us re booked on a Delta flight since all other AA flights were sold out. Success! So we thought. Delta was too incompetent to figure out the new reservation, even after we gave them the new confirmation number and showed them the email we received from Delta conforming our new flight - once Delta figured out what was going on (they took too long) and then said the flight just closed and we were no longer allowed to check in. Now we had no flight home and had to start all over again. When asked to speak with a Delta supervisor, we were told that one was not available and because the guy was only a trainee he couldnâ€™t help us. Thanks to AA  they were able to help find us another flight. I will never chose Delta for a flight option ever. Their customer service is one of the worst Iâ€™ve seen!"

The airline service is okay generally, but not for a team out for a robotics competition: we were in Houston for a robotics competition and checked our robot before the flight. However, the ground staff made us dissemble our robot, which caused significant damage. Also, I think Delta's fares are relatively high when compared to its competitors like, which may be a concern.

There is always a reason why they leave you sitting in the airplane minutes after it lands. This airline is horrible. My most recent experience yesterday (8/22/18) we sat on the runway for 30 mins and I missed my connection. Now we are sitting here again after landing finally in New York. This time thereâ€™s some excuse about something breaking down. Itâ€™s such a joke. Very frustrating. Not only are you sitting in a little baby airplane for hours all scrunched up but then you canâ€™t even get off when you finally arrive. 15 mins sitting as I type. Unreal.

One of the worst airline experiences of my life with irresponsible, and horrible customer service. This was supposed to be a direct flight from MSY to NYC. It left several hours late due to a landing gear failure, yet they still flew the plane - but only to Atlanta! From there they would not let me take my checked bag off the plane, even though they were switching planes and I notified them I would be booking a ticket with another airline from ATL since they tardiness caused me to miss my flight to Ireland at JFK. I landed in Ireland 9 hours late, spent and extra $1300, did not get refunded on my Delta flight, and on top of that am still missing my bag 2 days later. Unreal."

We had a flight from hspan to Detroit then to Montreal. The Japan Detroit was great people were amazing but once we got to Detroit everything went down. We asked if we can move our layover flight earlier as delays started to appear they said if it's not 90 min they can't or we have to pay 400 usd in total for a flight change. We decided its not worth it. So we took our original flight next morning which has been replayed since 5 am. Its been delayed with no explanation again and again. The staff at delays usa is completely rude. Do not answer questions i mean who is training them? Do they even get training? I am literally still sitting here waiting for a plane which is so stupid because I am only 1.4 hours away from Montreal. Horrible. 1st time ever using them and last time ever.

I was in a great disappointment since we are traveling to Canada I couldn't leave without a passport. One of the ground crews showed her empathy and kindly lead me to the special help crews. They talked and came up with a plan, since it was early in the morning and we are close to Chicago (~8am), they tried to help me get to Chicago Passport Agency (closed at 3pm) and have my passport renewed on the same day. So that they booked me a ticket to Chicago and rebooked my trips for the next early morning leaving from Chicago all for free! Since I needed two 2""x 2"" pictures and form DS 82 before I go to the CPA, staff helped me to find a nearest place where I could get those documents, and she even walked me down to the ground transportation. It was a long day and lots of running, but I was so lucky everything worked so smoothly, I was at Calgary just about 12 hours later than our original arrival time.

Flight could have waited less than 5 min for the late delta flight to get off as next flight was one gate down. Oh and we couldn't get off flight because a truck was blocking gate.

Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it. Can't recommend this airline after receiving my belongings in such a state. Basically I received poor customer service, 12 hours added to my travel and over $300 worth of damage/lost items."

Worst flight experience I have ever had. I have flown a lot for work and vacation. Delta Airlines cancelled my flight due to â€œweather conditionsâ€, but the nothing supported that reason. Delta failed to plan for contingencies and left several individuals and families stranded at JFK without any accommodations or productive solutions for their customers. The staff were rude and displayed no compassion to the travelers. Bottom line, do not fly Delta Airlines."

I booked a trip to Vegas for a wedding. The flight was delayed to the point I was late for the wedding. There was absolutely no customer service. Every employee I talked to trying to get a different flight just blew me off. One actually told me I should have booked with another airline because all the Delta flights are late. She was correct. Every single flight has been delayed. Its cost me a total of over 8 hours of layover time. What a joke. Awful customer service and nothing but late flights. I would recommend any other company besides Delta.

There were mild showers for 30 mins or so, but most other airlines were operating, even Delta had another flight 4 hrs later on the same day to same destination. They could have delayed the flight by 2-3 hrs, but they cancelled it and booked a flight for 14th morning. It will throw off all my subsequent plans (extended hotel stay in New York, plans in BUF and flight booked from BUF back to NYC). I tried booking some other airlines within 2-3 hrs, the prices of which were $600-700 for each ticket. It was a very uncomfortable and stressful experience."

I asked the staff to repack my bag, removing something out and re-scale the weight. She blamed me and talked many words. She wanted me to pay the heavy-bag charge just because to complete everything quickly. Then I gave up and let her charge the fee. She completed printing the tag and receipt and said ""a hundred dollars"". I have just known the fee at that moment. She never informed the fee before. 100USD is about 80% of my ticket price. My friends checked-in at the counter beside. Staff advised them to re-pack. She was very polite and helpful. Poor me, wrong counter, changed the experience. On cabin experience, everything went very well. Thai cabin crew on board was very very nice. She was very helpful, respectful and service-minded. All other crews were also nice. Overall experience over the Delta domestic short flight was good except only one bad ground staff at the check-in counter."

In fact, we never actually ended up flying and did not make it to our destination. We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control; however, this is the first time I've been cancelled due to weather. In the past, I've been delayed for a long time, but not cancelled. We rebooked on another flight, this was 3 hours later, and it gets delayed due to weather/late inbound flight, and once it finally makes it to the gate, we get ready to board, and then the gate agent announces that the flight was cancelled again literally just as the plane is about to board. Some airlines like to keep delaying the flight and are really hesitant to cancel, where as Delta just decides to give up and cancel the flights. We went back to the counter and asked to rebook and there was one agent there who was literally the opposite of helpful, and he kept asking us to wait a minute, and then stand back, and to give priority to the people on the Paris flight, and my dad had to call his attention by saying, ""Don't worry about us. We're just customers going to go to New York,"" and the one woman that was standing next to him gave another sarcastic remark, and then they walked away. We waited an hour and a half on the phone to ask if we could be reimbursed. They were willing to give us our money back. I've flown Delta many times without incident, but I have to say I was quite disappointed this time. I'm not saying I won't fly them again because I will, but this was an experience that really let me down.  They are usually good to us, but this was an experience that I won't soon forget. My ratings for Value for money and Ground service are based on this trip. My ratings for Seat comfort and Cabin Staff service can't apply for this trip because we never actually made it into the air or even on the plane, so they are based on past experiences with Delta."

I checked in online and printed my boarding pass, but it took 35 minutes in a huge long line simply to drop off my bag in Austin. After arriving in Seattle, it took one full hour after the flight reached the gate before I got my bag!! From what the staff told me, the bags were unloaded from the airplane but no one was there to deliver them to the baggage claim area. We were all standing around waiting for our bags and it took a very long time for the staff to figure out what happened. Finally I got my bag and was given a ticket for some bonus miles, but the agent did not tell me that I only had 3 days to claim them. I waited until I returned home a week later, and by then it was too late to get the miles. The flight was expensive and uncomfortable The 6:40 am departure time was too early. And wasting over 1.5 hours of my time on dropping off and collecting my suitcase was inexcusable. Overall a terrible experience with Delta and I will avoid flying with them in future."

I had no other options to fly out of the same airport, so I had to switch to another airport almost an hour away. My return flight home was returning to the airport I had originally booked with and if I wanted to change that flight it would cost me more money since that flight was not cancelled. A whole bunch of phone calls and issues 3 hours later I had my new flight, but needed to now book a car to drive me since my car could be in Boston MA when I was flying back to Manchester NH. $150 later I had the ride, but the hassle of all this was not fun.

No explanation of where our bags were. Filed our missing bags report with KLM baggage office. Made several phone calls every day trying to track down our missing luggage. Call after call, lie after lie. Total disregard and lack of follow through. After day 6 I really started to panic when my husband received an email from Delta saying that our bags were delivered to us and the file was closed. No joke. I started calling like a maniac at this point. KLM and Delta - all different stories. Our bags showed up on day 11 of our 13-day cruise. Our trip was ruined. I have never been so furious, frustrated, and frantic in my life. Shame on you, Delta. Losing a customers bag for so many days and not taking responsibility for it is inexcusable."

The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care. Seat comfort - small, narrow. Cabin staff service - The only thing they can do is to bring you water. Conclusion: very high price for very low cost flight."

The entire experience was so terrible that it still gives me nightmares. The itinary from Seattle to Paris was uneventful. The horror started when I landed in Paris for the connection to delhi. The flight was cancelled due to technical issues, and Delta rebooked me via Air France to Munich, and then via Lufthansa from Munich to Delhi. Nobody however thought of these 3 things when rebooking me. France needs a schengen transit visa when changing the airports. I of course did not have that. I was denied boarding to Munich due to this. I would need new boarding passes from Air France and Lufthansa. Since this was a rebooking, the PNR changed. Delta did not provide me with that, and I had to run back & forth between counters in CDG airport to find Air France counters to give me the boarding pass. There was an available flight from Paris to Mumbai, but Delta did not book me on that. I eventually reached via CDG-DXB-DEL. The DXB-DEL was via Emirates, which was a pleasure. The whole ordeal added 12 hours to my travel time. Delta did not agree to any refund / compensation (they shook off any responsibility for this)."

The flight was delayed for more than 4.5 hours ( due to some cooling system issue with the aircraft ). This with an airline , which is supposedly in top 3 of US airlines. The customer service is a joke, only 1 person trying to answer questions of an entire flight. People missing their connections, and the response is a shoulder shrug. I also observed the ground staff to be rude, and unhelpful to elderly passengers. Delta does not care that when we reach to our destination at 1 am in the night, the passengers have to pay surcharge for Uber, and wont obviously compensate for it. Any snacks, and hot meals wont compensate for the terrible handling of the entire situation."

I sat at 51J next to two windows and the width of seat is large enough for me. The pilots did very well to inform the passengers and also reduce the effect of turbulence. There were one dinner after taking-off, one breakfast during flight, and one lunch before landing. These dishes were good and the snack was also great. I was impressive by the internet connection during the flight, even over the Pacific. That was a wonderful experience since I can keep connecting with my family, my friends, and others via the internet. For entertainment, there were many latest films and videos, especially I liked the documentary videos. Summary, even though I just flew in economy class, this was a wonderful experience."

How in the world does an airline not have a crew to fly a plane scheduled months in advance? Why is there no back up in place. Customer service is a joke, spoke to a supervisor who was condescending and absolutely useless, not at all sympathetic or customer service oriented.

When they discovered he turned 21 on that day they served him. Then they came back later with a bag of snacks with a hand written card wishing him a happy birthday. The same thing happened on the return flight. I thought it was a very personal touch and made him feel special. Both flights were pleasant, the aircraft clean and we even arrived a little early on both flights. I would advise anyone to fly Delta as the go the extra mile.

First of all this flight was delayed at least 4 times which caused our connection to get totally messed up many times. Because it left so late in the evening, we ate before boarding. Then within 1 hour of boarding they served dinner at 1am, which we had already eaten dinner, so we skipped it. Then we only got food again breakfast just before landing at LAX. Then it took over an hour to get through customs and then another 2 hours on top of that to get our luggage. Then we had to totally check back into the airport because we missed our flight and they made us leave. So now it's almost 8:40 and back through security, baggage and about to board connection and our tickets were invalidated and my wife's TSA wasn't applied to her ticket or app so the added pain there and landed in PHX after 11pm and all is closed in the Delta terminal. So didn't get any real food again until we left the airport after midnight which options are very limited. So that's from 9pm Tokyo time (our 5am) till 11pm to get any real food beside a breakfast snack. Worst experience I've ever had on Delta and has ruined us for all future air travel on Delta!"

We get on the flight in JFK and hit bad weather. Aviation rules say they let us off after 3 hours of sitting on the tarmac. It took 4 hours. There were a lot of us traveling and my brothers San Diego flight took off within minutes of them unloading our plane. The captain said the crew on our plane would time out in the air to Las Vegas so they just cancelled our flight. My in laws on a flight to Phoenix were also brought back to the terminal because their captain timed out. The best delta could do was get us home by midnight the next night via a ton of transfers but couldnâ€™t leave jfk until 2 the next afternoon as all flights were sold out. Then I find a San Diego flight that was supposed to leave at 7:25 but itâ€™s delayed until 12:40 so we get that flight because itâ€™s close enough. The soonest they can get us out of San Diego is 5 pm. Iâ€™m on the phone with delta and the lady talks to me for over 20 minutes. Most of the time on hold. I walked to the gate and asked the ticket agent about getting on the flight he gets us passes before this lady can get me off hold. Not sure what she could have possibly been doing. I decided to purchase tickets on southwest because now Iâ€™m getting home on Saturday and I leave again on Tuesday. We are returning from a 3 week trip and just want to be home. Iâ€™m also flying with children. We finally get on the San Diego flight but thereâ€™s no pilot so we donâ€™t leave until 1:40 am. But the icing on the cake is that we are given comfort plus seats and I ask for blankets and pillows when we sit down. The flight attendant says she will check when she gets a secondâ€”she was a little frantic over whether a pilot was actually coming. No one helps me so I try to sleep. Get up to use the bathroom and see the entire coach class with blankets and pillows. When I ask again, they are all out. The in laws were loaded on a plane to Atlanta, driven out to the taxi way and then brought back to the gate because the pilot timed out. Why even put the people on the plane?? They can cry weather all they want but the flight I got on had their entire crew time out so they pulled another crew and put them on this flight so we could take off. Itâ€™s interesting how forth coming these people are with their information. This crew could have been given to the vegas flight. I canâ€™t see how itâ€™s cost effective to strand 100â€™s of people. Iâ€™m paying and extra $800 to get home because delta canâ€™t get their act together. And then I canâ€™t get a blanket?"

Delta delayed my fight and denied me a seat on an earlier flight with an available empty seat. I was at the gate 45 minutes before takeoff, had my ID out, and boarding pass in hand. When they asked if I had checked a bag, I foolishly answered â€œyes.â€ The supervisor used that as the reason for denying me a seat, citing it would be a â€œsecurityâ€ issue. So I guess every time we fly on a Delta flight with a bag belonging to someone who missed her connection, we are risking our security?? Does it take Delta over 45 minutes to locate and transfer a checked bag?? Is an ontime departure of a plane with empty seats more important than customer service? I wonder how Southwest and Jet Blue handle this scenario â€” based on customer reviews, I am most certain it is not like Delta does!"

The flight was changed at the last minute and was not even notified. When I took my kids the the airport for the return flight they didn't have My Ex's info so I had to give it to them again. When my kids arrived they didn't let her through security because they said I didn't pay the fee to have them accompanied by Delta employee. Which I did. I cost me an extra $300. So they were going to have to walk by themselves down to baggage claim. Something they have never done before. Complete lack of organization.

We got off of our cruise ship at 9am on 7/20/18 and were required to take the shuttle to the airport where I waited with my mother, my 14 year old son and his 14 year old friend. After waiting all day for our 6:40pm flight we were informed it was delayed over four hours and we would miss our layover flight from Atlanta to Dayton because of it. So they gave us standby tickets for an earlier flight (from Orlando to Atlanta) that was already overbooked; when I asked about getting a hotel room at the Orlando airport for the night and just traveling in the morning I was told they wouldnâ€™t cover any of the costs and that we needed to take our original flight to Atlanta if we couldnâ€™t get on any earlier flights and for the second time we were put on standby for yet another overbooked flight (they offered $600 to people to give up seats) because they were already overbooked. They went ahead and changed our missed flight from Atlanta to Dayton to the following morning at 8:10am so we were supposed to be all set for when we finally arrived in Atlanta. Finally we boarded our very delayed flight to Atlanta after being at the airport for over 13 hours when we arrived in Atlanta at 1am there was no one to help us find a hotel or somewhere to sleep so I went to the help phone to ask them. The delta help lady on the phone informed me we werenâ€™t even secheduled for any flights from Atlanta to Dayton!!!!! She went ahead and set the flight up for us (she was the only helpful person; she also informed me that the closets place to stay was not within walking distance) so we had to nap in chairs at Atlanta airport until our 8:10am flight. Then our 8:10 flight got delayed another two and a half hours so here we sit we have been at the airport for over 24 hours with absolutely no accommodations (besides one nice worker NOT with Delta that brought us blankets and snacks at 2am because everything was closed and she was off of work for the night). This mornings flight is said to be delayed due to weather however when I tracked the plane it is still at its last destination where the weather is clear....we do have rain in Atlanta however all the other planes are arriving and departing just fine! Delta is a joke and I will discourage everyone I know from using this horrible airline!"

It was a fairly last minute trip so I scheduled a flight from Detroit to Tampa and paid around $450. I scheduled the 8:20 PM because I didn't know what time I would be done with work. It turned out my assignment ended early so I got to the airport at 1PM to try to get on a 3:30PM flight. At first I was informed there would be a $75 fee to change to the earlier flight which was fine with me and well worth it. Then after looking up my fare the Delta employee told me that I could not change the flight because I had an economy fare. The only option was to buy a new ticket for close to $500 on the 3:30 flight. I asked if I could go standby they said no. I asked if there was anything I could do to get on the earlier flight short of paying another full fare. They said ""sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can."" So the 3:30 flight was delayed until 4:45. I hung around hoping I could get on the flight. I tried again and Delta said that if the 8:20 is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight. I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed - sorry. Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats. The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it. The flight left. Not 10 minutes goes by and I get an email saying the 8:20 is delayed. Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers. They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra $75 but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another 4 hours. My flight has been delayed to 8:45 and I am betting it will be later than that. Fly Southwest - they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight. They are very accommodating easy to deal with and generally care about their passengers. I will not fly Delta again."

On our return trip, the plane was very late leaving Bozeman for Minneapolis. We only had 10 minutes from deplaning time to our departure to Peoria. That young man, pushing my wheelchair, was also very helpful. When we exited the tram from Section D to Section A, we heard our names called for the flight. We were at A 1 and going to A 13. My 53 year old daughter said, should I run and the young man said Yes. She started running and then my 61 year old daughter started running and passed her sister.

Basically it took Delta 3 weeks to find and deliver my bags. To add insult to injury, Delta decided to compensate me with $100, and even that, it's a voucher I have to use towards my next ticket purchase with Delta.

My wife had to speak to gate agent on speaker phone to even get her to do basic customer service. The lack of compassion this gate agent showed is appalling. Regardless of any additional fees paid or not the safety of a minor should have been Delta Airlines main priority. Leaving a minor stranded without rectifying the issue is unacceptable. It should not have taken a call from an adult to fix. She knows her job she chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum or actually even less than that. With all the bad press Delta has been receiving you would think that retraining your agents would be a priority. Shame on you Delta Airlines for leaving a 16 year old kid crying hysterically and doing nothing to solve the problem. Your lack of compassion and human decency is noted.

Our Delta experiences have always been lackluster but these past 2 trips have been horrible. We consider ourselves to be consistent flyers of Delta (4 flights a year) and seem to be considered part of the â€œlower classâ€ in their terms. Being forced to fly in zone 4 everytime has began to reveal the garbage service of Delta. Using zone 4 we NEVER get to bring out bags on board and always have them checked in. Zone 4 also NEVER gets to choose where we sit and get our entire family split and stick in the middle seat all through the plane. Our trip from Washington DC to Detroit was a short bearable trip as it was an hour but this past trip was horrible as having my children with randoms spread across the plane is a horrible way to treat a family. Upon calling to fix our seating the situation got worse, the computer system told us they would call us back in 3 hours . This is ridiculous customer service. They finally called back and told us we could switch with other passengers but NO ONE wants to switch seats to sit in the middle and we were stuck in our horrible seats.

The seating in economy class was in a 2-4-2 configuration and I had an aisle seat in the two seat block. The leg space was sufficient. A personal IFE provided opportunities to view movies and tv shows, listen to music, and track the flight. Controls were easy to use. Earphones were provided. Selection was on the small side but was sufficient. A menu flier was provided - I chose a vegetarian pasta dish, it came with the usual accompaniments of salad, bread, and dessert. Beer and wine were complimentary. A light morning pre-arrival snack was served. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Luggage space overhead was ample. A sleep mask, pillow, and blanket came with the seat. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. At check in at JFK's Delta terminal 4, I printed out my boarding pass from a machine and did not have to interact with an agent at a desk. The organization of boarding was more or less smooth with gate agents making announcements and screens displaying boarding status. There was no anxiety or stress at the gate.

The flight had a maintenance issue, which in itself is completely understandable and that I was ok with. Our flight was from San Diego @ 5:25 pm with a layover in LA for 1.5 hours to Vancouver. We were told the flight had been delayed for 10 mins. Come back the flight is delayed for another 10 mins. Come back again and the lady said if it is anywhere past 6:20 we have to come to the front to change our flights as we would miss our connecting. Again totally fine, I am in a line up with one person in front of me awaiting the new update (currently states 6:20 departure) - flights delayed until 8:45pm - again totally fine. Then things start going south. The line was told if we wanted faster service to take a red card and call the number to change flights so I take a card and step out of line as I had to meet my boyfriend to let him know what was happening. I call the airline and there isn't a single flight that night until the next day. Ok that sucks but fine... we both have to book off work the next day now and so I asked politely if there was anything that they could do to make the situation better (aka seat upgrade). Nope notta. Fine. Well can I continue booking my hotel then as I would hope you cover that. Sorry mam, but you have to go to the ladies at the gate to book a room - so now I have to go back to the same line I was encouraged to step out, again 1 person in front of me before. 1 and 1/2 hours later (4 hours since arriving at the airport) finally get to the front- again. I explain to the same lady who told me to step out of the line what happened and again politely asked for anything to make the situation better - again nothing. Standard hotel room and food vouchers which are only good at the airport  which we cant use for the meal we already ate while waiting for the delays. Then on our first flight they didn't seat us together and on the second connecting flight (2.5 hours) there were no TV's . This was pretty ridiculous there was zero customer service in handling the situation. We had to take another vacation day which we couldn't even take advantage of because anything worth going to in San Diego takes a full day. At the end of all of it they couldn't at least put us in Premium economy or give us credit we could use for something outside of spending more time at the airport or upgrade our room. I strongly suggest not taking this airline. Cancellations don't happen often but I would rather be stuck with an airline that cares about their customer experience rather than one which is just trying to fill seats. (San Diego restaurants however happily covered each of us for drinks so props to those guys for knowing something about customer service.)"

This connection was last flight of night so we had to leave the next morning at 9:45am. We had to spend the night at a hotel gave us a small voucher for. The rooms were full when we arrived, as were the next two hotels rooms. Delta gave no other accommodation, customer service was atrocious and deplorable at best. On our return flight their was no air and was super hot. We are still currently in the airport now waiting for a delayed flight. We will never fly Delta again, and they will not see a single cent from me or my family again. On a side note customer service in ATL was texting while assisting us."

In several years of traveling, I have yet to have a problem free encounter with delta airlines. This most recent trip has had two flight delays, one that caused us to have to take a shuttle to another airport to get a different flight so we wouldnâ€™t miss our connection and the other over 2 hours delayed. They ran out of meals on our 10 hour flight from Amsterdam to Seattle, so my family was left with the snacks that we left over. They tagged our luggage improperly, but luckily I was paying attention and caught the mistake before they sent all of our bags. They did send one down the belt with the wrong tag on it and couldnâ€™t figure out which bag it was, but we managed to get that fixed just in time to run to our plane, even though we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart. Iâ€™ve traveled all over the world, and Iâ€™m sad to say that airlines from third world countries seem to operate more professionally and efficiently than delta. I tried to give them this one last chance, but I think Iâ€™ll just avoid them from now on."

So I just want to give Delta flight attendants a high five, whoever had that music playing thank you. I dont usually fly Delta but I may in the future return."
1446,9,26,June,2018,Economy Class,Indianapolis , Ft Lauderdale       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This was the worst flight I have ever been on. The flight attendants were rude and disrespectful. I was having an anxiety attack and went to use the restroom as soon as the plane was in the gate, but I was unaware that the seatbelt sign was still on. If anyone has ever had an anxiety attack, you feel detached from your surroundings and it can be easy to make a mistake like getting up to go to the restroom 3 minutes prior to receiving permission. When I got to the restroom, one flight attendant told me to sit down, and as soon as she said that an announcement came on so I paused to listen. While I was trying to listen, both flight attendants began yelling at me to sit down so I could not hear the announcement and I was already shaking from my anxiety attack. I went to sit down, the seatbelt sign went off, and I walked back to the restroom. I was so nervous that the flight attendants would yell at me again that I waited for them to tell me it was okay to use the restroom. One of the flight attendants looked at me, angrily reached in front of me and yelled ""PUSH"" to show me how to open the door as if I were completely incompetent. I didn't say anything and went to the restroom, but while I was in there I could hear the two flight attendants talking about me. Overall, this experience was terrible, and the lack of humanity in Delta airplanes shocks me."

Only fly Delta as a last resort. My sister was at the airport all day. Initial plane with mechanical problems. Waited several hours for another plane, which came from Madrid. Finally got on that plane, sat on tarmac for 2 hours, and returned to gate for mechanical problems after hearing horrible noise on replacement plane. So two planes in one day with mechanical problems. Then they had to get another crew. So if two out of two planes have mechanical problems, this is airline to avoid at all cost. Who knows what type of old planes with tons of mechanical problems they are using. Oh, and by the way, none of the electric outlets worked on second plane."

Customer service is garbage, takes hours to speak to someone and is a pain in the ass to make any adjustments to your flight. Upgraded to what I thought was Delta One (lie flat) instead got the single most uncomfortable first class seat Iâ€™ve ever sat in. Itâ€™s a bit wider than a normal seat but hard as a rock.

She had to sleep on the airport floor which is obviously very painful for someone who had lower lumbar surgery a month ago, and is handicap. They could not get her a hotel, so they offered her was $90 in food vouchers. What is that, two meals at an airport? She had to buy her own blanket and pillow. Was not offered a mat. I am appalled by this treatment.  I have had nothing but bad experiences with Delta. I will never fly with Delta again."

The lavatories on the right hand side were all closed due to pump problems. The seats were comfortable, food was good. They served dim sum for breakfasts, which was delicious. The flight entertainment option was good. Free wifi for texting, how cool! Cabin staff were friendly and always helpful. The gate agent was sympathetic to my long transit in Salt Lake City, i was given a meal voucher. The only thing is they change the flight time to create the long transit that I had to endure at the first place. Sadly the route from Hong Kong to Seattle will be axed, I feel sorry that this route has to be dropped. The flight was always full according to the ground agent, why drop the route?"

I was instructed that I must pay an additional cost ($76 per ticket) to have seats together. I paid the cost but the day we were to fly out my family was separated. I went to customer service and was told there was a change in aircraft. There were still 38 rows - why were we separated! I choose the back all the time because I have a 4 and 5 year old. At the counter, the attendant said ""not my problem"" - horrible customer service and at this rate this will be my last Delta flight. I paid extra to sit together and was told it's not their problem.

At this point we are the only people in the airport here with the night workers and construction workers. You have people sleep on the floors and sleep anywhere they can. This is very inconvenient!

This is not premium economy at all. All it is seats with 3 inches more pitch. You get the same long boarding line as economy, same cabin, same seats, same meals, everything the same except a little more legroom. On top of that, a boarding system that was laughable and bad food (I mean inedible). This, for an extra $1000 per person, was insane. On the other hand, flight crew on both flights were excellent, as was the selection of movies on the in flight entertainment system. Save money and fly economy."
1463,10,11,June,2018,Economy Class,Chicago , Shanghai , Detroit      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Verified ,"  This flight was delayed by one hour or so, which made me miss subsequent flights Delta 0121 (MSP to HND) and China Eastern 0540 (HND to PVG). This delay caused me to change my subsequent flight to next day which caused a penalty of $1,187.90 that I had to pay to China Eastern. Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG. After calling 2 to 3 times a day, finally I received my luggage 4 days since my original flight. I was on a business trip and my stop at Shanghai was primary for meetings scheduled for Saturday April 28th, due to delay, I missed these meeting and my stop at Shanghai become worthless. I couldnt make up for these meetings since Monday and Tuesday was a Holiday in China and I had to continue my trip to my next stop in Wuhan. The damage caused by this delayed flight and luggage is difficult to quantify beside the cash penalty that I paid ($1,187.90). I would like per this complaint to explain all the negative impact I went through due to a delay of a Delta flight.Resolution: Sugar coated email with 7500 bonus point.

Our flight was delayed multiple times making a 3 hour delay and would result in missing our connecting flight into Seattle to make it to Kauai. There were no later flights this same day to Kauai, so we were scheduled for the next morning to fly from Medford to Seattle (now weâ€™ve missed our first night of vacation). After asking the airline how often this happens, she responded maybe 1/15 planes are delayed and was unlikely it would happen again. Then our next morning flight scheduled for 5.45am and was for the second time, delayed 3 hours to 8.30am and we were scheduled to miss our connecting flight in Seattle once again! Although Delta re-imbursed tickets and we will still make it to Kauai this evening through yet a third scheduling conflict - it has put us behind 24 hours into our trip. Needless to say I will not be planning on flying Delta Air Lines for quite some time- at least out of Medford. Completely ridiculous."

I get emails from Delta all the time saying how sorry they are and that the amount will be put into my account but it never happens. All emails they send cannot be replied to. There is only one Norwegian phone number provided that transfers me to KLM Holland. They transfer me on to the USA where I am put on hold for long times. I hanged up once after 34 minutes. I have called and spoken to a number of people I have been transferred to but never end up with the right person. They all tell me to go to [emailÂ protected] I have done that several times but only end up with emails saying how sorry the are and that the email cannot be replied to. I has been a nightmare and no one takes responsibility. But they are extremely good at saying how sorry they are and send email to me time after time that the money will be transferred to me!

The plane is old, this one was over 21 years old, but well maintained. Seat pitch in economy is tight. The IFE content is excellent, although the system had to be rebooted after take off, which took 30 minutes. Recommended. The ground handling at both Amsterdam, with the ridiculous questioning due to US regulation, and the line at Orlando for US immigration make DL to loose some stars, but can't be entirely attributed to the airline."

That is how far out we booked our travel plans. For the first time we decided to try first class. Now, the flight out was much better than the return which is what I am rating here. Note above my indication of how far out we booked. So, we checked in online and confirmed our return flight. We went to the airport and got our boarding passes (should have looked at them at the desk) but when we went to board were told we were in zone 2. Indeed the passes showed seats 24A and B. Went to counter to see what was the reason. Never got a clear reason. Change of plane (was same model as indicated on travel plans) a passenger being moved over (shouldn't we have been given priority?) and some other reason I cannot really recall right now. Let me also point out that our baggage was checked as if we were still first class which would seem odd if we were bumped to economy. Now, they told us we will receive vouchers because of this event (first class) and some refund. We are still awaiting an answer on that and our travel agent is helping. Then, oddly, just before we boarded, a seat opened up in first class. (No, we did not take it as we wanted to sit together) Delta, your service is extremely lacking. You had our contact information and never did so. Your ""explanation"" of the event was so full of holes, cheese cloth, in comparison, is wax paper."

When I finally exited the plane, I learned that the gate is A49 in another terminal, take an escalator, catch a tram, etc - I have less than 20 minutes. I was running through the airport using escalator, tram, walkways and made it by the seat of my pants. Travel should not be this way!"

Delta was not straight forward with communicating flight delays. Resulted in entire flight being told at 1:30am that the pilots left to get a hotel and our flight would leave 8am the next morning - after waiting at boarding area since 11pm. No hotel service offered by Delta and non available at 1:30am. Only option was to sleep at the airport. Following morning flight did not board at 8am and was continued to be delayed and told only after the boarding times came and went. Again Delta was not straight forward with the fact that numerous other flights were before ours and they knew the entire time our flight was never going to board at 8am. Renting a car and not going to wait around for Deltas lack of proper communication. Not the first time this has happened due to bad communication about delays!

Delta Platinum reservations are awesome, but theyâ€™re the ones trying to get the money. Delta customer service is very lacking. The gentleman was extremely crude and belittling.

This was an Air France code share operated by Delta - got a really good price right after New Years. on IAD-BCN, Madrid IAD multi-city flight. Seat comfort much better than AF outbound. Couldn't get the limited wi-fi to work. Best transatlantic flight I can remember."

To look up a trip, I have to enter information for each flight so Delta can look them up. I purchased a flight for a family member and never received an email confirmation. Therefore, I didn't have the information to enter into Delta's website to look up the purchased flight. Infuriating!"

On Sat May 19th, 2018 My husband and I arrived at the gate - plane terminal at 2:55 after waiting around the airport since 1:00. I followed a woman to the ramp of the plane where she did not return for almost 8 minutes later. Our plane was to depart at 3:15. When she returned, I told her our names, she told us we had missed our flight and there was nothing that could be done, that we needed to go over to the phones ""customer service"" to find out when the next flight would be available. My husband and I followed instructions and immediately went to the phones, during this time that I was placed on hold, handing the phone to my husband, I had then witnessed a gentleman in a red coat assist a person onto our plane? Next flight available to Seattle would not be until the following day departing at 3:15. This cost us additional rental car and another expensive nights hotel stay considering it being a weekend with several conventions going on. Our luggage had went on to Seattle along with some very needed medications causing me to flare into a major migraine not able to rid for days, until finally my Dr. was able to give some relief by giving a (nerve block) shot. All of this because we had arrived 20 minutes prior to plane departure. My husband and I have never been treated so poorly in our entire life. Greatly Upsetting."

While I am waiting on my flight, I got a total of 25 text messages telling me that the gate has changed or the time of departure has changed. 6 Gate changes. 19 departure time changes. First they said we were delayed because the plane in our gate from the flight before needed some maintenance but our plane was waiting just outside. Then our plane pulls in, and it is out of service for maintenance. Then they say there is another plane on its way that will take us. Then that plane gets here and there are missing crew members we have to wait on. All in all it was delayed 3 1/2 hours. During all of this, when it is clear I won't make my connecting flight, we talk to customer service who says go ahead and get on the flight and the gate attendant will give you a hotel voucher when you get there because the flight I would be missing is the last one out. We say okay, no problem. I get there and go to the gate attendant. He says, you need to go to customer service. I go to customer service, stand in line for an hour, they say, go to a gate attendant. I go back to a gate attendant. By this time I am so angry and upset I am on the verge of crying, but I am trying to be polite to this innocent gate attendant that is getting caught in the crossfire. She finally takes pity on me, looks it up and says that she will give me a hotel voucher and gives me some tips about when to come back in the morning because it is one of their busiest times. Then I go catch a shuttle to the hotel, but have to wait for the 3rd shuttle because there are so many people in the same situation. Then the hotel has a line out the door to get checked in so by the time I actually get the key to the hotel room, I have three hours before I have to leave for the airport again.

This is the worst flight I have ever been on, and I have been on many flights throughout my life. After traveling more than 10 hours through the UK and Amsterdam (and waiting for another 10 hours in airports) we arrived in Minneapolis. We only had one more hour to go before being able to get home and go to sleep, when Delta happened. Despite troublesome weather, we were still set to depart on time, which was a relief - at first. We boarded the plane, as normal, and then waited. For more than two hours. No acknowledgement was made by Delta that this flight would be late; instead, they kept stating that it would only be another ""10 minutes"" before we could take off. Ten minutes turned into changing the route, having to add fuel (a 45 minute venture) and adding half an hour to the new flight time. Don't fly with Delta. Instead of taking ownership over their mistakes (like not marking the flight as delayed or boarding us despite bad weather) they will instead treat their passengers horribly when they try to figure out what is going on and respond rudely when the passengers question when they will be leaving. Worst flight of my life, and I do not recommend."

I called them to see what the deal was with her getting bumped from her assigned seat. I was told there was a schedule change and seats sometimes the seats get scrambled and there was nothing they could do. I could, however, pay additional for 2 premium seats together or ask a stranger to switch me seats.

So instead a rude flight attendant tells me to stand to the side and wait with my carry on out of everyoneâ€™s way. Well I was still in your customers way and had them angrily telling me to move. I then waited for everyone to be seated and they made me carry my bag back to the front of the plane before I was able to be seated.

The next flight out was the next morning, we had to get a hotel which was fine, our luggage was no where to be found. We asked for the luggage to be pulled we waited an hour and a half, and found one of our bags out of four. The issue I had was no one was watching the pulled bag area. My brother whoâ€™s bag was pulled was sitting in the middle of the terminal unattended. We walked over to the bag and sure enough it was his.

The flight attendant was going to upgrade me to first class but there was a dog there also and only God knows if I was allergic to that breed. I was moved to the back of the plane and allergies were kept at a minimum the entire flight. Delta, please come up with some kind of system to inform passengers that animals will be in the main cabin.

In addition it was close to 6 hours long so I was interested in travelling first class. To my surprise the first class ticket was only $200 more than the economy and around half the price of United. The plane was new, the interior and seats nicely appointed, food passable and IFE was excellent. Although the movie selection wasn't great, live TV (including sports) made up for this. For and internal US flight, the fact that it took off and landed on time was a huge unexpected bonus. I will consider moving programs to Skyteam as I think they're impressive."

The problem is that I had to check out from the hotel at 12:00, which means that I had to wait at the airport for 10:30 hours. Delta also gave me one coupon to have lunch (one meal in 24 hours, thanks Delta for keeping me slim). The best part of the story, however, is that I got a seat next to a giant guy so I had to sit in half seat during my flight.

I received an email shortly thereafter that the flight was delayed, and that I may not make my connector flight. Once again, I called a rep who verified such, and she booked me on a flight going out the next day, the same trip I had originally booked, only one day later.

Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Tahiti. We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly. Flying out of Minneapolis on Delta we sat on the tarmac for over and hour because of mechanical/electrical issues. Even tho the issue was not fixed, de-icing proceeded and we left for take off. Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation. Trust me you do not want to shop in Tahiti on a Sunday for toothpaste/toothbrushes and swimsuits. Thank you Delta, it is much appreciated. On a side note, I would fly Delta again and also Air France where the service and food were exceptional, even back in steerage."

I am writing this review for whoever flies Delta. When you find a deal on say, Expedia, for any Delta flights, before proceeding with your booking, call Delta with the details of that particular flight, ask them to match the price and ensure that the skymiles are added to your account. It seems like the Customer service department is very poorly trained and therefore every representative gives you different information. My message to Delta Airlines is, kindly train your staff well so they know what the heck is going on. Also, it is imperative that Delta customer service agents take responsibility for each other's actions and Delta Airlines as a Whole, rather than saying, its not my department or the Delta agent gave you the wrong information, they didn't know etc. Thank you."

I fly them almost exclusively and have seen their service continue to decline. On this trip outbound from JFK surprising I did not get my upgrade. First problem the cabin interior was old and stodgy. The entertainment system needed to be rebooted twice and the GOGO WiFi was a NOGO. Worst of all my seat did not recline. Lovely for a transcon flight. On my return I got my upgrade but shockingly the tray table in my premium economy seat was broken. I had to eat from my lap. In all my travels never had a tray table been broken in an upgrade section of a plane. Especially on an important business route. Iâ€™m taking my business elsewhere to try someone else.

When I booked tickets on the Delta website earlier this year to fly from London to Costa Rica I got all the way to the final screen without any problems only to find that when I clicked 'Buy' a pop up screen appeared telling me that there was now a high demand for these seats and if I wanted them I'd have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more. Delta might find this to be a great way to screw extra money out of your customers (and after all, they are an American company) and it might even be legal; but it's dishonest, unethical and just plain wrong. I've never known this from any other airline in over 40 years of flying. Secondly, as we flew over the Atlantic my wife and I were on the extreme right hand side of the plane, the guy on the same row in seat A had his window open - everyone else had their windows closed as the sun was low and very bright. This caused everyone in the row to have very bright sunlight in their eyes, we all complained to the stewardess who told us that the guy needed to work on his computer and so needed the window open to see the keyboard, I have to note that the window was partially closed so there was no sunlight in his eyes, just everyone elses. No matter how many times we complained the stewardess refused to tell the guy to close the window, so this went on for several hours, it made it difficult to see the entertainment, it made it impossible to sleep and it  made the whole experience very unpleasant.  Given the way several US airlines have treated their passengers over the past year I doubt that I'll ever fly on an American carrier again, they obviously don't care about passengers. As a further point, Atlanta airport is the biggest dump I've ever had to spend any time in, I'll avoid it like the plague in future"

I sat patiently to get my flight at 8 when it was announced that the flight is delayed and would go only at 10. The plane came in late and we boarded and was to leave at 10.20. But captain announced they are waiting on some equipment alignment and kept the plane oh hold without any further announcement. Itâ€™s gong to be 11pm now and the flight is still grounded.

The flight attendants (all males) were extremely rude to my husband and I. They had an attitude with everything they were doing, Iâ€™ve never experienced service like that. Usually flight attendants are always super accommodating and sweet. Disappointed about this Delta!"

Delta uses the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse in Heathrow which is a fantastic lounge. On board, the Delta One product was excellent in terms of the seat itself, food and beverage quality and the service from the crew. The departure of the flight was delayed slightly due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft but arrival in Atlanta was on time. The IFE system was reliable and had an extensive selection of content. The onboard WiFi was however quite unreliable."

They seated our 5 year old in the exit row with us then reseated him by himself. The flight attendant refused to help and told me to exit the plane and speak to the gate agent who also refused to assist. There were 20 open seats on the plane two in the â€œcomfort areaâ€ which they refused to let us use. Second leg my daughter was seated two rows from her two year old. Ended up there were duplicate tickets and she had to put him on her lap for a two and a half hour flight. Keep in mind she paid for a seat. No customer service in either case. I wouldnâ€™t recommend Delta to anyone traveling with children.

Once airborne, a really nice breakfast sandwich, which I was not looking forward too, as I usually prefer omelets, potatoes, etc. Really surprised at the quality here. Accompanied by very fresh fruit and more Bloody Marys. Departed and arrived on schedule. 2 hours in the renovated Sky Club in MSP. This is where Delta has really started to pull ahead. Their lounges have upgraded food options, with hot and cold items available. The standard free liquor is fine, but reasonable cost to upgrade to the premium stuff. B738 from MSP to PSP, a 3.5hr flight. An extremely nice lunch with chilled Salmon and Quinoa, followed by dessert. Enjoyed a great selection of wines, while watching a few movies to help pass the time. On-time departure and arrival, with a quick collection of our bags in PSP.

Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta  and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more. Obviously there's no respect for customers. Flying with low cost companies is better than Delta!"

We had 12 pieces of luggage since we were moving in Seattle for a long period of time. Our main concern was how to handle the kids and have the luggage transported from the airport to our house (including 3 car seats and a booster). After asking our flight attendant, he has spoken with his colleague and before we knew it, they came out of their way to help us load all luggage into their personal vehicles and had everything delivered to our house.

Flying from Cozumel thru Atlanta on 4/15/18. Our connecting flight in ATL was delayed due to a scheduling error by the airline. Once that was resolved we got on the plane, but were again delayed. We sat on the tarmac for 2 hrs before the plane returned to the gate due to a mechanical error. By now it was nearly midnight. Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 9:15 pm. We were then told no flight was available til 7:00 am the next day and weâ€™d be given hotel vouchers, but would need to be back at the airport by 5:00 am. The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude. I will never fly this airline again."

They used a 767 for a 11-hour international flight, the plane was very dirty and run-down. The touch screen on the entertainment TV barely worked. The volume was also way too quiet and I could barely hear my movie over people coughing loudly. The second segment from ATL to SFO was much worse despite being only half as long. Boarding took forever and I got stuck sitting next to a man with a nasty cold. His constant loud coughing/sneezing/grunting made it impossible for me to sleep on the near-red eye flight. When we landed it took 30 minutes before we went up to the gate. For some reason that always happens every time I fly Delta. Anyway, baggage claim also took longer than usual because an announcement said the cargo door was having difficulty opening properly and because the carousel wasn't decided until the last second. I'm never flying Delta again unless they upgrade their aircraft and stop overestimating the arrival times. My flight to SFO was estimated to be 6 hours, so the ground staff at the destination prepared for that duration. But since the actual flight time was only 5 hours, we had to wait longer to go up to the gate. By the way, the 737 used for the second flight segment was much more cramped than the ones used by United, and I flew first class."

I used my companyâ€™s travel agency to switch my flight back to Boston to the red eye. I didnâ€™t realize that the agency booked me in the row in front of the emergency exit, meaning the seats in that row donâ€™t recline and it would require me trying to sleep while sitting at a 90 degree angle. There were many open seats after takeoff so I moved to the row in front of me. There was one man in that row in the aisle seat, and his wife was adjacent in another empty row. He very reluctantly allowed me to pass him to sit in the window seat of his row after I explained I wanted to sleep before returning to work in Boston the next morning. Not 20 minutes after I had fallen asleep, the Emporer of aisle 15 had gotten the flight attendant to ask me to evacuate â€œhisâ€ row. The attendant said that I was sitting in an economy plus row. No problem; I did not pay for an economy plus ticket and was more than happy to move to any other row with a reclining chair. I asked her to please tell me where I can move to another open seat. â€œSureâ€, she says, and walks away. I gather my belonging and she comes back to say rudely â€œYou have to moveâ€. I asked if she knew which seat I could move to, and she said there should be some in the back. Super helpful. The only open economy seat was at the very back row which also didnâ€™t recline."

Being that Delta tickets are more expensive you would think they would have nicer planes. The last flight I was on was delayed for two hours while we were sitting on the runway and the captain of the flight didnâ€™t even tell us what was going on. The flight leaving to Minneapolis from Anchorage was delayed by almost 6 hours! Seriously, they have a record of being the most delayed, slow and honestly the worst communication to their passengers. Since I live in Alaska there are very few airlines to choose from but if I had a choice I would avoid flying with them at all cost."

First, I did not see the difference with the economy until I noticed a little red strip on the seats. When asked, they are said to have more space between rows. Not very visible. Especially since you are in the same cabin, same food. By the way, now access to priority lane or else. Just a boarding before economy. I fail to see the advantage. Due to poor choice, crazy price, and a time constraint I had no choice but to take this airline and premium eco. I ll avoid this airline like the plague. One last thing. I asked on both way to be upgraded, I was ready to pay for it. Not possible! You have to do it 72h before - even in the 80s some airlines were upgrading you at the boarding desk."

On the way back the flight attendants were more helpful but when I arrived into LAX there was a flight leaving for SFO shortly so I asked if I could take the earlier flight so as to avoid waiting 2 hours in an overcrowded waiting room that did not have enough seats. I was told there was room and I could get on the earlier flight. Then my name was looked up and they told me that since I had an economy ticket I could not change anything and could not get on the earlier flight.

The lower level staff members generally do, but the company itself and higher ups (aka policy makers) clearly don't. The customer support team and staff agents are virtually powerless and can't really help customers when it matters. Policies are in place to prevent the customer support team from helping the customers by doing simple things like waiving fees or making flight changes easier. The only thing it seems like staff members have the authority to do is provide customers with an extra set of Biscoffs during in-flight service. It's unfortunate because I used to love Delta but now feel a strong sense of distrust and dissatisfaction with the brand. I don't matter to Delta and neither does my brand loyalty. The employees seemingly aren't allowed to make any changes that aid customers unless they charge them an arm and a leg first due to the company policies. Delta customer support doesn't actually help customers without charging them fees for ridiculous things like flight change despite already having forced customers to pay upwards for $25 dollars extra."

At this point we are 4 hours out from our original departure time. Right as boarding was supposed to begin another hour was added to the delay. This is my first time flying alone. I am 18, unfamiliar with this airport. The pilot told us they checked the circuit at 7.10, when they realized there was an issue, 5 minutes before we were supposed to leave! Why wasnâ€™t this examined prior to boarding an entire plane of people? This is unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers time and money. Not to mention that this was a connecting flight causing issues for many people on the plane to miss their next flight in Atlanta. I still have not boarded, so chances are that the flight will be delayed another hour. Bad service."

When I saw it, the employees would not give it to me saying that they could not give it to us because they didn't ""know"" that it was mine. Never mind that I could identify the bag and its contents!! Instead, we had to leave the terminal and claim it at baggage claim (how do they know it is my bag there when they have ripped off the tag) and then go back through TSA (always fun) to try to make my connection. The last time I flew Delta they wanted my 5 year old son to sit 10 rows away from me. Thanks to a kind fellow travelers, we were able to sit together. Delta simply said ""sorry""."

They nickle and dime you for everything and even have a scam to try and get people to pay extra for seats they could have for free. They have a ridiculous charge of $75 if you wish to switch to an earlier flight, which is crazy considering the fact that the seats are already available. They claim to have free WiFi on board but it has not worked on a single Delta flight I have been on. Do not fly Delta if you can avoid. The experience is truly terrible and makes me hate traveling."

Both of us were told the site that was the case. Actually, the entire seating chart showed a very sparsely populated cabin. Not the case. It was packed. I believe they tried to make up for the horrible food with sheer volume. There was more really awful food than I'd seen in quite some time, and I will eat anything. The WiFi didn't work. The toilets were not clean. I will never fly Delta again. Worst 8 hours I've ever spent on a plane."

I cannot believe how they over book their flights and seats that were paid for months ago are now in limbo, that is messed up. I bought 2 tickets with the intent to sit next to my fiance and instead I was placed sitting across the aisle in the middle of two passengers, people I do not know. This type of insecurity and un-reliability is extremely poor. I will never fly again with Delta."

Here are some of the good and bad about that flight: The Good: - Staff always nice - Pillow (low quality) and blanket (very good quality) available at each seat. Bottle of water provided - Clean airplane. The Bad: - Announced on time but boarded 20 minutes late (would have preferred to say in lounge an additional 20 minutes instead of standing at gate) - Sitting in the back of 1st Class did not get my choice of meal. I wish I could pre-order like with AA - Online IFE would not load correctly so besides a good selection of movies, I could not watch any (tried multiple browser on a laptop and iPad). Very limited choice of snacks Leg room: Average Recline: Good."

The terminal in Chattanooga had two chargers for the whole flight, I left my jacket at a seat and crowded around the charging station with everyone else. I forgot my jacket with house keys and upon arrival at Atlanta half an hour later tried to call into Chattanooga to ask the attendants to pickup the jacket. I asked several attendants and a customer service manager in Atlanta for help, but no one could be bothered, just said to file a report online. Delta never picked up the jacket, or what they did with an old Army coat I will never know. Very disappointed, they could care less about the passengers. I had to replace my house keys and business keys."

I did not know this and I thought I did not need to be on look out for this since I was dealing with Delta. Wrong. I bought 4 tickets and two of them are for my kids. Because of this deception now my kids are going to be sitting with strangers in the middle seats. The cost per leg of our trip to pick our seats is $120 per ticket. The cost to pick our seats would be $960. Flying Delta is like flying on Spirit now. Be careful when you make your reservation, Delta is deceptive."

I just got back from my vacation to Cancun. Arrived at Hyatt Ziva with five friends and learned that they only had 1 room booked under our reservation when we had booked 3. Delta stated our reservation only had 1 and refused to help. This was even after we demonstrated to the representative that it is impossible to book the Hyatt Ziva with 6 people in one room. The hotel will not even come up as an option on the Delta Vacations website if you put that # of people in one room. The hotel supervisor said that she had not seen this happen in her 15 years working there. It is against hotel policy to book more than 4 to a room. They made a special exception to make sure we weren't sleeping on the street. There was an obvious error on Delta's fault and they did nothing to help remedy the situation. We took turns sleeping on the floor and even outside on the room's balcony. Delta is unwilling to take responsibility.

And we were handed a phone number to try to straighten out this mess. No, you created the problem! Why should we have to call? This is customer service? Try Alaska Airlines!"

However, after talking to four people who said they were unable to help me, the ""red coat supervisor"" finally changed tickets for my boyfriend and me at no charge. It was an honest mistake of mine and, after 4 days in NYC, we were exhausted and ready to get home. Not to mention both having work the next day and no extra money for an outrageous change fee.

Stewardess saw my distress and called for any medical personnel on board. A nurse came up and another with medical knowledge. Stewardess brought sugar and orange juice. We had to force feed him because he was totally out of it. They went back and got my son and daughter-in-law. All of us crowded in to take care of my husband. Even the pilot came up to talk with us and was checking out the situation. He was going to divert the plane to a nearby airport and had already lowered the altitude. They had an EMS waiting for us at the gate, and they took him directly to a hospital. To sum it up, the attention he got during this medical emergency was second to none.

I'll avoid using Delta in future. I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times."

On the flight from Hawaii, we were delayed an hour (stuck on a hot plane).

Customer service at the gate was lacking to say the least.

Staff stated multiple times that there was â€œno need to stand in line if you have questions about the flight as I wonâ€™t be open to questions about this flight for another 10 minutesâ€. The flight she was talking about was headed to Florida and was not my flight. I continued to wait patiently as she continued to repeat her statement about not waiting in line for questions. Finally I said to her that I had a question about the next flight out, not the current one. To which she replied, well I donâ€™t know anything about that flight. My response was to ask her if she knew anything about the gate check in seating and how that works as Iâ€™ve never encountered that before. And her response was beyond dismissive and rude. She waved her hands on the air saying â€œhow would I know anything about that, just go to customer serviceâ€ as she walked away from the gate with a line of at least 4 customers behind me. She is an extremely poor representation of Delta and, in my humble opinion, should not be working anywhere with people or customer service. She was offensively impolite, snide, and I was left unhelped in any way. Based on my interaction alone I would not recommend Delta to anyone."

On a flight going from Detroit to Sault Ste.

They gave us a coupon for a hotel since we all had to stay the night, but the coupon was only $1 off the regular price. When I followed up the next morning their helpline informed me that a request for an additional flight was never even submitted. They didnâ€™t even try to get people there in a timely manner and instead are making people wait to (hopefully) get in around midnight the next day. This is over a full 24 hrs that we have been stuck in the airport loosing money since we have to take additional days off work now and spending more since we had to get a hotel and meals on our own dime.

Delta was beyond belief this past weekend. I was already annoyed that I had a connecting flight, so I booked an early in order to make an appointment in San Diego, CA. My outbound flight to MSP was delayed so much that I missed the connecting flight to SAN. Once I arrived in MSP, I was directed to the service desk for assistance. The Service Desk agent displayed absolutely no empathy and told me my next flight out was going to be with an additional connection through LAX. So I was originally going to get to SAN around 1pm. Now with the delays and re-route this was going to push me back to 9pm. I asked at the service desk if they compensate their customers in any way and she said ""Well, if you were here more than 8 hours we would give you a meal voucher and Delta feels if they get you there within 24 hours then that is the best they can do."" Her words, not mine. I was floored. So I asked her to terminate my trip in LAX and I would get my own transportation from there to SAN instead of sitting in the airport another two hours. I get to LAX and no bag! I ran like a mad woman to baggage services so that they could keep my bag from going on the connecting flight to SAN. The agent there was emotionless as he put a note in the computer and he told me to wait 20 minutes until they respond. I said ""Uhm, can you call them please? I would like to get my bag and leave."" He said ""ok."" I mean why do I have to instruct you on how to extend good customer service? He called and my bag was produced within the next few minutes. I tried to purchase a ticket on another carrier for my return flight home in a couple of days, but they were just too expensive. But I can guarantee, I will not fly Delta ever again after this. It seems like the airlines, Delta, American, and United included only treat you with a small sense of dignity when you have status within their frequent flyer program. So sad, but true."

No delays, good service by the flight attendants and a reasonable price one way 98 USD. The problem was the overpricing of the baggage. PR got devastated by a monster hurricane Maria and my family needed a generator and my sister did the same route and same airline and payed 25 dollars for the same generator. I left 2 weeks later (October 29th 2017) and paid 70 dollars for it. In general Delta is fine except the baggage overcharging in a emergency situation in PR."

My flight into SLC was delayed just long enough to miss my connection to my home town, for the fourth time in a row. As usual, the only options Delta suggested required me to pay out of pocket, for a hotel or rental car. Somehow, no matter what the cause of my missed flight is, they have exempted themselves from offering any sort of compensation (â€œOh, we canâ€™t do anything about that.â€) This time they did change my flight to a nearby city, but with no way of making it home from there. It kind of seems like an attempt to look like they are trying to help while actually being the opposite of helpful, unless stranding me with no way home is considered helpful. Unfortunately, my employer books exclusively through Delta, so I will likely go through this again. SLC plays loud piano music all night, with regular security announcements. I guess they want to make sure no one stranded at their airport overnight has the chance to get a little sleep. Four trips in a row that were pretty enjoyable until the last little bit, then itâ€™s all ruined by incompetence."

I made a snap decision to travel with family to see family, tickets bought no backing out. It was a beautiful flight so much so i spent a lot of time looking out the window watching the flight navigator on the seat back so i knew exactly what city were were flying over. We were all seated together on a fully packed flight as well which was a bonus! Although we were in Economy we were treated with the same respect as first class! The Pilot was great, flight attendants were great, snacks were just right. The plane itself was stunning to see inside and out. Spacious, clean, plenty of leg room with free in flight movies, games and much more on every seat back. Headphones were not included but only $2 to purchase.

We paid higher than the ""going rate"" for our flight especially because we wanted a smooth overnight return so that we could return to work the day after return. The flight over was very good, we were impressed. But, our connection from Richmond to our NY overseas flight was suddenly cancelled. The ground crew hardly knew how to cope with such. They claimed it much be weather, though had no idea. As their flights to other NY airports were flying, and the weather report looked fine this could not be the case. After much back and forth we were routed through Atlanta (still suffering from the hurricanes) and then Amsterdam. This was the longest return we'd ever experienced in our 30 years of regular travel between the UK/US. Needless to say we could not return to work the following day as planned. So initially we were very disappointed at how poorly Delta handled our return. We can only assume that the flight was cancelled because they hadn't the numbers, and thus the profit. This was the first clue of a problem. The confused and almost useless ground staff the second clue. Note that we had to work with them for a realistic return as their initial proposal did not allow adequate lay-over time in Atlanta given the airport size. Then on return I wrote a complaint to Delta. Next clue was that complaints are automated through a soulless computer process. Then I was warned that they were experiencing a high volume to customer service requests and while they hoped to answer in 30 days they could not promise. 30+ days, seriously? Well they passed our complaint, about Delta's handling of our custom, over the KLM who few the transatlantic flight. They must never had even read the complaint. Since then we've had two emails from KLM about how they are too busy to reply but will soon. So now it is almost 4 months after a complaint and nothing. Just so disappointing.

Delta One is decent as a transcontinental business product. On the Boeing 767-300 it is a 1-2-1 staggered layout. However, the shell of each seat is way too short, creating a less private experience. The catering service was great. Three entree options were provided and were accompanied by an appetizer, a salad, a soup, and some deserts afterwards. Delta uses Westin's Heavenly bedding onboard all of their Delta One flights which was very comfortable. However, the poor design of the seat caused the situation where there was no room for my feet to move when the seat is in its lie-flat position. The flight crew was very friendly. Onboard Wi-Fi was useable but extremely slow. The overall experience of this flight is not bad and I would definitely fly Delta One for transcontinental flights if good pricing is available."

My flight was schedule to leave Washington DC at 12:45PM so that I could catch a connecting flight to Vegas at 3:45PM. Around 11:30AM, they announced that the flight got 1 hour delay and would arrive at Detroit approximately at 3:20PM. I told myself that it would leave me roughly 20 mins to run from one gate to the other gate. I accepted my fate and kept on waiting. Then, they boarded us. As soon as we sat down on the plane, we got another notification that the flight wouldnâ€™t leave until 4:20PM, so they deplaned us and told us to check with the customer service desk for assistance. I went there and they put on another flight that would arrive in Vegas at 8PM local time. There was nothing else they could do, they said. Now Iâ€™m sitting here waiting to board still. Iâ€™ve been waiting since 10AM - avoid this airline if you can."

Our flight was delayed for the amount of time it would have taken to get to our destination, risking us to miss our connection flight. We were parked on the runway for an hour. The flight attendant was obnoxious & rude. Prior to the flight, she went up & down the aisle multiple times counting the number of passengers. Even while more passengers were still arriving on the plane & waiting to get seated. She was discouraging & asking why people were arriving on the plane so late. She tried to push a customer to grab his seat immediately for take off, but was blocked by others placing their carryon baggage in the bins. He had no choice but to wait. She announced the flight delay on the intercom & said we would take off in 10 min. 10 min later, she announced the same exact thing with the same amount of time. During flight as she was passing out snacks & beverages, she purposely walked pass my aisle with my brother without offering goods & commented, ""Oh, you didn't say anything so I assumed you didn't want anything."" As a flight attendant, you are obligated to accomodate your passengers by asking about their needs & promoting their offers first hand. Overall she just had rude, uncaring behavior."

I'm not complaining about our flight being rebooked, or anything else weather related. I am complaining because I spoke with and saw a number of Delta representatives, all of which were told we were traveling with infants and none of them printed infant tickets causing us to be seconds away from missing our flight sucks. Our luggage was lost in JFK (I say lost because no one could tell me where it was) and the average wait to get luggage was 1.5-2 hours and we had to wait 4. Our items were damaged and missing the Delta representatives are clearly sick of speaking with customers because they are all extremely rude and have just run out of care to give to their customers. So Delta you clearly owe your reps some lunch or a bonus or something because they are making matters so much worse by just not caring. Now I have filled a claim online for my damaged items however the website would only accept one upload, so I have no idea if you got the picture of the damaged personal items, luggage, or car seat but I'll be more than happy to go over all the information with someone in the estimated 6-8 weeks I was told it would take for a Delta claim member to follow up."

I was coming in internationally from Cairo, Egypt and had a transit time of 3.5 hours. After a 12 hour flight I was not notified that my flight had been canceled. JFK airport wifi is not very good so I was not able to get the necessary information. I claimed my luggage and went to the check in desk and to my surprise they had canceled and rebooked me for next day, it was very urgent that I fly out. Delta did not assist me with any hotel booking, I booked and paid for one for myself and being a first class passenger I was extreamly disappointed. Now we are trying to change tickets online and due to the restrictions on my ticket I am unable to do so online, furthermore their hotline is hopeless giving you a wait time of 2 hours call back and they don't call back!"
1599,7,11,January,2018,Economy Class,Portland , Orange County , Seattle     ,Solo Leisure,United States, Trip Verified ,"  Raleigh Durham to Seattle via Atlanta. My initial flight was from RDU to SEA on 01/08/18 early morning reaching SEA at 9:30am. Then Delta had a scheduled flight change and the arrival time in SEA got changed to 10:20am. I had an important meeting to attend at noon on 01/08 so I requested Delta to put me on a flight on 01/07 night instead which they did. My new flight was from RDU to SEA via ATL with a stopover of 45 minutes. The flight from RDU to ATL got delayed by 15 minutes. The RDU ATL flight arrived at gate B18 and the ATL SEA flight was from gate E6. Why would they even suggest such an itinerary with 45 minutes of stopover. I ran my heart out and reached gate E6 10 minutes before departure but the door had already closed. There were plenty of other passengers with me. Could they not have waited for 10 more minutes? Was it so difficult to see that there are other people connecting to this flight who had landed just 10 minutes before, more so given the fact that the flight was the last flight for the night to SEA from ATL? After that, I got rebooked on a flight to SEA via SLC reaching SEA at 12:30pm on 01/08. So basically the reason why I prepone my flight to 01/07 in order to reach on time for my meeting, you are now taking me to SEA even after my original direct flight from RDU to SEA. I told the gate agent about that and she was outright rude. I said I have to attend the meeting and I will take a non delta flight and reach SEA on time for my meeting. She told me that I wont get any refund since I am already rebooked on a different flight. So basically I ended up spending the whole night in ATL, waiting 4 hours in the terminal to get my bag out, and then ended up taking a 6:15am Alaska flight to SEA. I would never ever travel on Delta again. This was the worst experience I ever had and the gate agents and customer support is no good and outright rude."

When I created the mishandled baggage claim for the item, I was told that it would arrive at JFK at 9 that night, Friday, January 5th, and be sent to our hotel immediately so we would have the bag by the next morning at the latest. By Sunday, our bag hadn't arrived and we had spent four plus hours on hold collectively. We arrived at the airport for our return trip, hoping to collect our bag there and depart. At one terminal, we were given the exact location of the bag and when we arrived there, were asked to wait for over an hour to get the location of the bag, which I already had. There were hundreds of bags misplaced and Delta was very inneffective at fixing the issue and almost made us late for our return flight, which was subsequently delayed by an hour, thirty minutes of which we spent sitting on the runway. This is the last time I fly with Delta or use the JFK airport."

I'm extremely dissatisfied with my experience with Delta. After arriving at San Diego International Airport at 430am for my 7am departure our flight was delayed over and hour. This delay was not due to weather. We landed at JFK Airport and we waited well over a half hour to even get off to a gate to de-board. This caused me to miss my layover to Syracuse, NY. Although Delta did pay for the next flight out to Syracuse, NY via Delta airlines, this turned into a 4 hour layover. Now that we are finally ready to depart from JFK and finally on my way home after an exhausting day of unexpected travel, we are again delayed not due to weather but waiting an another plan to land so other customers can make this connecting flight. We were supposed to depart at 856 and it's been 40 minutes. Yes, I'm frustrated but also upset due to the inconsistency of the airline - why couldn't my Delta connection wait for all the passengers from JFK to Syracuse instead of leaving right at that moment."

Got here at 5pm for our 8pm flight yesterday, endured 5hrs of gate changing and ridiculous excuses and lies. No available gate, waiting for Egyptair to finish. Prepping said plane, then more gate hopping for several hours. Back to waiting for Egyptair to get off. Waiting for cabin crew to prep - no cabin crew as theyâ€™ve finished their shift and we have to wait for the next cabin crew at unknown time of arrival Boarded a few people, then made them come off the plane as it was â€œtoo coldâ€ as the engine had no fuel! Pilot didnâ€™t even know how long itâ€™d take. We have all collectively concluded that none of this was true and later found out that flights to London never take off from the gates we were made to hopscotch between. Then on the 7th hour at 2am we were told that the next flight was at 6:30PM. Queued for 3hrs just to ask a question which took us to 5am. With 13hrs wait time ahead of us, we were unable to leave and with zero facilities here, no shops open, no hotel rooms nearby, rude useless staff who kicked sleeping mothers and children out of airline lounges. Overheated space with nowhere to sit, no water offered and no care to those with young children. I saw so many dismissed and sent away from the airport without any care. Absolutely disgusted by all this. Only this morning they took the initiative to give out some drinks and muffins to those with newly delayed flights. Clearly the mediaâ€™s hitting hard but what about the rest of us who endured 12hrs last night, held hostage and treated like cattle in dirt with no food or bedding? Utterly disgusting and to top it all off, my sister just asked for a pillow from a Delta employee and her rude response was â€œI was handing them out at 2 last night, theyâ€™re all gone, what do you want me to do about it?â€ No care, no kindness, no sympathy - just a mockery of what weâ€™re having to go through."

First the airplane was super old and extremely dirty. We had checked a bag and there was only one rep. Second trip was even worse, will try to avoid them. Horrible customer service.

I purchased 5 first class tickets from Georgia to Colorado with a connection in Atlanta. Circumstances led my sister to need to fly out of Atlanta and return in Atlanta. (We knew we were losing the extra money for her Savannah flights but she was keeping her same seat on her Atlanta flights) I waited on hold for three hours to let Delta know she will no longer need the flights I paid for from Savannah to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Savannah. I was then informed it would cost an additional $448 to allow her to check in in Atlanta. As a result, she drove 3.5 hours to Savannah to make the Savannah flight. The day before the flight, I tried to check all of us in; however, my sister was no longer on the itinerary anywhere. So i waited an additional 1.5 hours to see why she was no longer on the itinerary. Turns out the delta rep who tried to change her flight information gave her a different itinerary number. To compensate, Delta gave us a $100 voucher to use to purchase any delta tickets. On the flight home she did not board as she needed to stay in Atlanta. So I allowed my nephew to sit in her seat that I already paid for. Deltas employees then made him get up and go to his assigned seat in the main cabin so one of their pilots could sit in the first class seat I paid for! Very unfortunate that Deltas employees choose to make sure they are comfortable rather than the paying customers. Extremely disappointed in this airline. I will not be recommending this airline and will try to avoid using Delta for future flights."

Each flight they didn't tell me the 3rd time it got delayed, I found out at the airport. The first flight they didn't say anything at all at the counter I had to find it on a TV after we hadn't started boarding when we were supposed to, customer service is rude, they don't care about their customers, the boarding agents are angry and aggressive.

A nice Delta employee tried to check me in anyway but then later she said they can't open the gates since flight is sold out and she said I must call WestJet. I called WestJet, on hold etc back and forth with them, to make a long story short they told me I must re-book with Delta who again (different person) they cannot help me and I must call WestJet. Out of frustration I left the airport since I wasn't getting anywhere and it had been 2 hours of trying to book another flight. I later booked with Expedia out of desperation since I needed to get back home to Calgary and flew out the next day same flight same airline (Westjet operated by Delta). No one will compensate me.

When we arrived at the airport, it was an absolute mess with little staff and loads of people trying to check in and get through security. It was unclear what we were supposed to do and we waited for a long time before realising that we were supposed to use the e-kiosk for check in. Boarding was also an absolute mess with no clear line or anything. It took ages to board as people were blocking the aisles. After we settled in, it was a pretty comfortable ride to New York and we arrived early. The IFE has really a lot of content and was more than enough for the journey. The rest of the journey was smooth, except that we had to walk 15 minutes to collect our bags."

Checked-in a relaxed manner due to great staff. Unfortunately flight delayed by 90 mins - hence a mark down; saying that we were well informed all the time, so credit to Delta. Boarding and flight was fine and efficient when it happened - end of the day only a one hour filght (and one hour delay). Despite delay, us and luggage well taken care of. Would fly Delta again."

Process of rescheduling was somewhat stressful. Westjet and Delta staff were helpful but their systems do not interact well. Worked with Westjet gate attendant then followed that with calls to Delta, Westjet and finally Delta again to sort out a flight change for the next day for a Bangor to RDU routing. Flight out of Bangor was delayed. Gate agent at Bangor was greeting passengers as they reached the gate area, offering snacks, pre-checking bags, thanking everyone for flying Delta. He was also proactive in assisting those who needed help with wheelchairs or pre-boarding. Flight BGR-LGA was okay - crew efficient and professional. Connection in LGA went okay, flight to RDU boarded a bit early but pilot came on the PA and sounded very frustrated as he advised us of a last minute route change from Air Traffic Control. This caused a slight delay in take off. Flight was okay as well though very unusual - we flew very low (about 5,000 feet according to Flight Tracker) for most of the route. This made the trip a bit longer than scheduled but the pilot kept us informed so not a big issue. Flight attendants also efficient and professional. Considering the challenges of flying out of the US Northeast due to the Christmas weather, Delta did a very good job."

The flight departed and arrived on time and the staff were pleasant. We really didn't like that we were not able to choose our seats. We had to check in at the airport, using a machine, which allocated our seats. As we were right at the back of the plane, we were not particularly surprised to find that there was no choice left for us when the first meal was served. However, when it happened again on the second meal, I have to say that I was pretty annoyed. They had also completely run out of the icecream and there was no excuse for just not having enough of something that was not a choice. I cannot understand why, having disappointed us the first meal, they could not have served us first on the second meal, the kitchen was directly behind us and they had to pass us to start serving from the front again. We ended up having nothing at all to eat and my husband was ravenous. The meal we had the first time was pretty poor too, I mostly ate the cheese and biscuits."

Less than an hour after taking off, the captain comes over the speaker to tell us that the cabin pressure system had malfunctioned and to remain safe we had to stay at 10k feet and divert to Cincinnati. We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service. They informed me that it was going to be another hour. The hour passes then it's two hours. Then three. I talk to customer service to see what I could do about missing my connection. I was given 3 options; have a six and a half layover to wait for the next plane, fly back to Charlotte and try again in three days, or give up and get a flight on a more reliable airline. On top of this awful situation, in the past I have been snapped at by customer service, delayed four and a half hours because a kid puked in the aisle, ignored by chatting FA, and left stranded in another country for 18 hours. Do not trust this airline to get you anywhere in a safe or timely manner."

Once at the gate, the flight got pushed out by another hour and eventually we were moved to another gate for departure. Boarding was delayed yet another 30 minutes but was conducted by zone and in an orderly manner. Onboard the seat was comfortable and having purchased an exit row seat, I had ample leg room. The service was prompt and we were offered drinks and a choice of 4 snacks. The FA were efficient but lacked warmth. The flight eventually departed with a 3 hour delay and was late arriving after in Tampa. We were briefed on the nature of delays which were not directly the fault of the airline and most were the result of the supremely inefficient LGA. Overall a pleasant experience for a domestic flight in economy."

So, over the night we had 1 inch of snow in Portland and our flight was scheduled for 6:00AM. We get to the airport and see that the check in supposed to start at 5:20AM starts at 5:40AM.  We get jn the plane, it was already over 6:00AM and people were still finding their seats. I have to mention that our connecting flight in SLC was 30 minutes away from the PDX flight landing. This combo of flights was offered by the company I did not choose it specifically. Temperature outside was about 40 degrees no snowing, no raining and they had to deice the plane. Only that they started doing it at 6:15AM. Again, Our departure was scheduled at 6:00AM they start deicing at 6:15. Great customer service, especially after we got stuck on the tarmac for another hour so our plane ended up taking off at 7:15AM. We missed the connection in SLC. I go to the counter lady who of course told us that she will rebook us the second day. I said fine, so who is gonna cover our hotel and expenses? She said we do not cover that type of stuff when a delay is because of the weather? And here I give up, when you were already late with the boarding you act incompetent and start to deice the plane with 15 minutes after the departure time, when outside is clear sky and 40 degrees? When I brought up all these arguments to her she did not know what excuse to find and she said that she will not cover our expenses and she is the boss so I cannot talk with anybody else. So after showing a huge level of incompetency to your clients that paid for your tickets, you do not even try to make it up to them? Weather related means the weather stopped you from flying in time, not you having some ice on the airplane while the skies are clear since hours ago and you did not take the time to clean it."

Horrible service every single time. No one knows what is going on ever. Havenâ€™t flown with delta for 4 years because of how horrible they are every single time and I donâ€™t intend to ever again.

The day before our flight we were so excited to know that next morning we would be spending our Christmas Eve with my family. Unfortunately for us our plans changed quickly for the worst. At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasnâ€™t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didnâ€™t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if weâ€™re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldnâ€™t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right. Itâ€™s unfortunate because the weather was perfect out of California and Las Vegas. We will not be relying on Delta to handle our travel plans in the future."

Boarded the rather ageing aircraft with 40 rather cramped seats. Had to ask for a welcome drink, this set the scene for what was to be an underwhelming standard of service throughout the flight. They ran out of the beef entree along with the French red. Champagne was closeted away, the sauce with the chicken was far too salty for my liking. Amenity kit which is touted is very basic does not have a comb, however in its defense it does contain a generic hand sanitizer in gel form however would have been better had this been Purell.

I flew from the Philippines to Korea for 4.5 hours, then Korea to JFK (New York) for 14hrs, JFK to Minneapolis for 3.5hrs and scheduled on my last flight from Minneapolis to Winnipeg, Canada at 8:15PM the same day. Our flight from JFK got delayed and we arrived in Minneapolis around 8:30PM already and missed my connecting flight to Winnipeg. Staff told me that my next flight has been rescheduled on the following day Dec 10 at 9AM. I explained to them that I've been flying straight for 20hrs now and I need some good sleep. Airline staff only gave me an answer that they cannot provide me a hotel.  According to them the cause of the delay its because of the weather issues.  I understand that de-icing is all about the weather issues but its clear that there are also mechanical problem."

Delta Air Lines improvement is spectacular when comparing it to 10 years ago. The out-bound flight (BRU-JFK) was delayed 40 min but we were properly informed well in advanced. Unfortunately, the in-bound flight (JFK-BRU) was delayed as well, initially of 1h40 but informed when we had already boarded. Staff friendly, efficient (check-in, gate, attendants) even if like always there 1 or 2 staff which are not. Very good entertainment choices although too little dubbed or subtitled in other languages."

Would not recommend this airline to any person. Terrible customer service when they delayed our flight three times and ended up canceling. We were also told that there would be no flights to our destination in the next two days due to it being already full from earlier cancellations. Not to mention, the hotels nearby were already filled with reservation and they provided the least possible amount of customer service in a very rude along with unprofessional manner. Our former flight before our connecting flight was also a disaster to say the least. Never have I ever landed at the destination only to wait an hour just to get off the plane. Why? This was all due to Delta's poor planning of available gates for incoming planes. When we did get to the gate, we had to wait for their crew to actually do their job for once for us to actually enter the airport. That was an additionally ten minute delay. Absolutely terrible communication between their workers. Delta, get your act together and actually prioritize your customers."

We never have experienced big delays, the flight attendants are friendly and helpful, the reservations people are very helpful, and the seats are usually very comfortable. The entertainment is very good, the food is okay, and the legroom is usually pretty good. On this flight we got upgraded to Delta Comfort, I usually fly economy. Our flight from Seattle to Beijing was smooth, and comfortable. I highly recommend Delta Comfort, the extra legroom and recline really does make a great difference. Delta does do its best to satisfy customers, and those who gave Delta a bad review, I have to say that everyone had bad experiences, but in order to judge a airline, you have to have at least flown them 3 times in recent years (0-2 years ago)."

This airline does not work with moving your flights forward without an additional fee. However, Delta has no problem disrespecting your travel arrangements and pushing your flight back. For someone who will be traveling frequently for work, this is not who I want to deal with on a regular basis. I will take every opportunity possible to convince others to avoid this airline."

Myself and my wife, our son, his wife and three grand children aged 5, 4 and 2. Delta changed the flight schedule five times after the original booking including one with a suggested connection arrival time into Detroit after the flight to Amsterdam had actually left! I have never know so many changes to occur on what appeared to be a frequent basis! My issue however is with seat allocation and the way that Delta change it! On the flight from Orlando to Atlanta (A321) we had selected two rows of three seats one behind the other (the infant was not allocated a seat). Delta split this into 2x2 and 2x1 seats with the four and five year olds being allocated seats on their own. Madness! On the next flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam (A330) we had reserved a block of 4 seats in the central aisle of row 37 with two seats behind in row 38. Delta then changed this to the four in row 37 and two in row 31 so that (in their words) ""we could all be together""! Again the family were split up for no apparent reason! Do Delta have a vendetta against families sitting together? The food on this leg was also the worst that I have ever encountered on an international flight. Tasteless and inedible. It seemed to comprise random bits thrown together. The flights were cheap but so was everything else!"

The whole flight I was thirsty and hungry. The food that was served was so terrible. Half way into the flight I asked for a snack. It took over 45 minutes for me to get my snack, the staff was nowhere to be seen. The seat is very uncomfortable.

I usually fly United. Boarding was at 11:20am. I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault! This is the last thing I would expect from a flight attendant under the circumstances I was in. Will never fly with Delta again if there is other options available."

This flight did not last a full hour and I must mention that there is a marked difference between the friendliness of the international crew of Delta and the domestic crew of Delta. The domestic crew are far less professional on their behavior and attitude to passengers onboard. My connecting flight from Italy to New York arrived on time however the bags were placed late on the belt and by the time I made it through US customs and walked from gate 14 to 33 because no one in JFK was willing to help I arrived at the plane seconds before they closed the door. Upon entering the aircraft I was surprised because the flight attendant told me to sit in seat 4 D (Business Class) I thought this was due to the delay as a way of saying thank you I quickly found out she made a mistake and in front of everyone asked me to leave the cabin (I was embarrassed to say the least), realizing what she had done she offered me a ""Comfort Seat"", to be honest I did not notice any difference between that seat and a regular seat on coach. I have to say the aircraft looked brand new, clean and before I could buckle my seatbelt we were already in Philadelphia. Deltaâ€™s iPhone app is great for tracking your bags and other flight related info. My only observation is the marked difference between the domestic and the international crew. Overall I would fly Delta again, the planes look and feel new, clean, the seats and space are better than their other US competitors. Good job Delta just please could you retrain your domestic crew to be more like your international crew? Iâ€™m still a fan regardless of that!"
1638,5,10,November,2017,Economy Class,Minneapolis , San Diego       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Verified Review ,"  This was my first time flying Delta International from Milan to New York and I have to say I am impressed with their service and the attention to detail provided by the aircrew. I was hoping to get their signature airplane, the new Airbus 350 however the equipment we flew in Airbus 330 was very nice. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants if I could move to an empty row and she was very nice and said to me that I could grab any seat I wished so I went on and sat on an empty row of 2. I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they canâ€™t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure. I must make an observation about Deltaâ€™s new ""Comfort Seat"" Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s worth the money because I did not see a difference between that seat and the one I had. I hope they expand to premium economy on more flights. Overall I give Delta two thumbs up!"

This originally consisted of 4 flights. Spokane to Seattle and Seattle to San Jose and vice versa. Only 1 of those flights actually happened. I was notified and hour before my first flight that it had been cancelled and was only offered a flight leaving in the next 30 minutes or a flight leaving 6 hours later than planned. The flights did not go through Seattle either, they went through Salt Lake City. This wasnâ€™t a huge deal. I got to San Jose a little earlier than planned, but not without the headache. On the way back to Spokane, my flight from San Jose to Seattle went accordingly. However on arrival to SeaTac airport, I was informed of a delay. I was also told that I would be leaving from gate D4. I went to D4 and the screen said Eugene Oregon. So, I updated my email and it said I was actually to leave from S16. I went to gate S16. There was nothing. I asked the concierge desk and they said flight from D4 had left. So I switched to the next flight to Spokane. Which was only a stand-by ticket. I figured since I had an hour, Iâ€™d check if D4 had actually left. It had not. They would not switch me back to my original flight from D4. I am now 3 hours past my original time of departure waiting to see if I get a spot on the god forsaken plane."

A very pleasant experience with Delta, check-in and bag drop at LAX was seamless, despite long lines for the security at terminal 2. However the boarding process was a bit hectic and it feels like Delta is trying to cram as many flights into the small terminal 2 at LAX. Flight services on the cross-continent flight are wonderful. Glad to see they've upgraded the personal entertainment system on the 767s into newer larger HD screens. It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had! Food was well-plated and presented too, with a side salad and desserts. Delta also now provides free wifi for texting and messaging on all flights! This is a game changer! Big shout out to Delta for bringing back free meals and making flying an enjoyment again!"
1641,6,3,November,2017,First Class,Brussels , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience."

The seat was okay. Delta was very generous with their in-flight meals and drinks. The IFE screen on the A350-900 was large and very easy to navigate. As I was sitting at the back, the space in the overhead storage area was reduced to accommodate the crew rest area. The Narita-based crew seemed more approachable and friendlier compared to the Detroit-based crew."

We were told at check in we would receive seats at the gate but not before and they could not guarantee I would be seated next to my children, it could possibly be in front of or behind but they would not discuss why I didn't have seats. I was travelling with my two children and this was worrying. When we went through security we could not scan our boarding passes and were told by security that we were on standby. This was very upsetting, I had booked the tickets months earlier. Finally on the flight, my son, was in the row in front of me, the first statement the steward made was, ""We are very understaffed and I don't know how we'll cope"". Our return flight with Virgin Airways was wonderful. Everything from seats, 72 hours in advance with no charge, to staff, to check in and all employees were efficient, polite, and very professional.

This was my first time flying Delta and I was impressed. Delta's Comfort + was the most comfortable I've been on in a long time for the price ($1100). That's at least $300 less then other airlines economy class running the Asia route vs Delta's premium Comfort plus. The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.) Delta also gave free face mask, ear plugs and ear phones. Movie infotainment system selection was great. Leg room was ample my knees didn't touch the back on the person in front at all even at front on a full recline, I'm 5'10"". Seats were plush and soft and my the neck rest didn't feel annoying like some airlines that leave you craning. Would definitely fly again in the future. I hope Delta continues to service the Asia route because someone needs to take out United's long haul dominance and end them already."

Anyone below First class and business class were treated as second class citizens. On the return trip we didn't get a seat when we checked in online. It said that the seat would be assigned at the gate. Which gate? I had no idea, because Delta doesn't bother to put it on the ticket. Anyway, a line started to form as the agent got to the gate. She gave the first person in line a seat, the next person a seat and then the third person in line a seat and told the rest of us to sit down unless we were will to give up our reservation for a voucher. She said ""I need to work on the voucher people first"". I was second in line at that point and I asked ""will you at least call the people who were in line first?"" She said she would take my name; I didn't move. The man right offered to take a later flight, but when he was told it was the next day, he sat down. I ended up getting my seat assignments; I presume because she didn't want me to cause anymore trouble. She kept asking for people to take a $600 voucher to give up their paid reservation. Then they start on the carry on luggage threat. ""if you are in zones 2 or 3, there isn't going to be any room to store your carry on. We'll check your bag for free"" I don't want to check my bag, it takes longer to get out of the airport and my husband's bag has been lost several times. We ended up checking our bags and boy was that a mistake! the fly was short but bumpy. We went to claim our package and saw the 20 guarantee. What a joke! After 20 minutes with no bags I went to the baggage claim help center, which was NO help, they told me to wait another 5 minutes that the bags were still on the plane. the bags didn't come out until over 35 minutes.

I had only the casual clothes on my back, and had to buy clothes to wear during the day Saturday, clothes for a semi-formal affair scheduled for Sat night, and for a Sunday visit to St. Sergius Monastery. Shopping in Moscow is expensive and my XL size in most clothing is difficult to find. In a phone call to Delta Customer Service from Moscow (via satellite phone) I was told to ""buy what i needed and I would be reimbursed. "" Now, Delta is saying that their ""partner"" Aeroflot , the airline we arrived on in Moscow, needs to take care of the claim and will not help.

I got upgraded, which was basically the same as economy and my boyfriends economy seat had maybe 8 inches of leg room. This week we made the mistake of using basic economy which really means only middle seats in the back of the plane. Had we known that we would have picked a different option. My boyfriend canâ€™t fit in a middle seat, and he isnâ€™t even that big (6 ft, 190 lbs). We call Delta 1.5 hour hold times.

I asked you if I could get upgraded to first class the next day on my connecting flight due to all of the problems, missing my 65th Birthday celebration and I was told no. Instead I was offered a 200 dollar voucher or 10000 miles. Very poor offer with all that happened and making my 65th Birthday a miserable day. After all of the flights I have taken on Delta this year it makes me wonder if I am a valuable customer. I am a Vice President for a hotel company and had a guest presented these circumstances to one of my hotels, I would have treated that guest like royalty and given him the best room along with meals and even the next stay on us. Overall I am very upset. With all of the poor publicity that airlines are receiving for being apethetic towards their customers, I thought your company would have treated me with empathy and value my business.

The smooth proces of checking in and breezing through security and immigration shows the advantage of a quite small airport as Brussels, in comparison to my home airport AMS. Only disadvantage: poor lounge. Delta uses the BA lounge, which has very limited F&B options. Dissapointing. But the onboard experience was very good. The FA working in my area (seat 1A), as well the purser of the flight was very friendly. The other two FA's in C were very kind as well and we had long conversations. F&B: outstanding. The only con was the IFE. A bit limited in content and the overpriced WiFi wasn't worth it for me to give it a try."

On October 15, my husband, our two dogs (weighing 60lbs and 50lbs, respectively) and I boarded Delta flight 674 from St. Thomas. We were stressed: having just been through 2 category 5 hurricanes, the loss of both our jobs and relocating to the mainland, we had little in our emotional reserves as we attempted to settle into our seats. Our flight attendant immediately welcomed us and gave special attention to our heavily sedated dogs. Tina listened to our story and made us feel like the only passengers aboard the full aircraft. I witnessed her executing her duties throughout the flight in a professional, timely and warm manner, and being a lifetime service industry professional, myself, I noted how she engaged her passengers with genuine courtesy. The mark of a true professional is evident when things are going less than perfect, however, and she handled a potentially unpleasant situation with grace and expediency. We are now lifelong customers and will continue to recommend Delta to all our friends and family."

Me: Can I have both? FA: Did I offer you both? Me: Itâ€™s ok then, donâ€™t worry about it. FA: Iâ€™m only teasing! Not a funny joke! She humiliated me in front all the people around me that heard her! I would fine if she answered me with â€œyou can only pick oneâ€. Very rude. Will Delta go bankrupt over a cookie and a pretzel that she had to make a big deal about me wanting both? Iâ€™ve always like flying Delta than other airlines, Iâ€™m not sure anymore now!"
1658,5,18,October,2017,Economy Class,San Diego , New York      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  New York JFK to Tampa. Horrible experience. Delayed take off, due to mechanical issues. Ground crew asked to check-in all rolling carry-on, but no one helped while boarding. Flight attendants forget their mission is to help passengers and instead are bitter with a very bad attitude. Small legroom and no entertainment onboard."
1659,9,17,October,2017,Economy Class,Atlanta , Cleveland        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  Raleigh Durham to Boston. Flew Delta on three segments in early October. All flights were on CRJ-900 regional jets. Flights left and arrived on time. Crews generally pleasant and efficient. Pilot on the first flight (RDU-BOS) came into the cabin before departure to introduce himself and the crew and provide flight info - a nice touch. Seating tight but tolerable for a short flight. Planes in decent shape and reasonably clean. Delta had changed my routing after I purchased the tickets which was not an issue for me as the timing was essentially the same. However, they did not send an advisory on this but, fortunately, I double check reservations a couple of time before I travel so I caught the change. I did print out all my copies of the schedule to be on the safe side and this turned out to be useful. When we arrived in Toronto on the return leg, the computer system did not seem to recognize the revised booking. When we could not get our boarding passes and the agent questioned our booking, I had the documentation and, though it took about 15-20 minutes, she finally got us sorted out and printed our boarding passes. Of course, they did not work when we went to board our flight but the gate agent saw the correction and got us sorted out quickly. Everyone who worked on the issue was helpful which kept our stress levels (relatively) low."

Today the plane landed at the terminal on time, but the plane was broken. This 1.5 hour delay made me miss my connecting flight. They came over the announcement and said it was our job to ensure we scheduled our connecting flights when we land because it is out of their control. I have been away from home for 6 months and would like to be able to depend on an airline to get me there."

If this is going to consistently happen, I don't understand why Delta couldn't just plan for delays better because this is a waste of everyone's time. Even though everything else is sufficient, the lack of punctuality is very inconvenient."

They took the time to make sure I was doing ok when I was having a tough time with my assigned seat and the flights.

1664,1,10,October,2017,Economy Class,San Jose , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Verified Review ," This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. They changed my flight without notice, turning a 12 hour day into a 22 hour day of flying and sitting in airports. I could have forgiven that had their employees had one ounce of sympathy. Their cold uncaring response is what makes Delta the worst airline. One of them stated, well we have to talk to a lot of people, when I pointed out their awful customer service."
1665,1,8,October,2017,Business Class,Amsterdam , Seattle        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  One of the best flights I have been on! Two of the flight attendants spent time letting every passenger know their connecting gate in Detroit and how to navigate the Airport. This was amazing and appreciated by everyone. All attendants should be giving passengers this kind of service and she did it with a smile!  Will continue to use Delta and hope the airlines train all employees to be like this! Great flight, #2807 4:59 from Laguardia to Detroit."

I hate flying Delta and this is the last time I will fly Delta. I was forced to use Delta this time. You would figure a major airline like Delta would have figured out how to be on time. Hawaiian Airlines hardly ever has delayed flights."
1668,1,3,October,2017,Economy Class,Atlanta , Bogota ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Australia, Verified Review ,  Flew Edmonton to San Francisco via Seattle. What a pleasant surprise - a domestic US carrier that is working hard to improve customer service. Check in was efficient and staffed by helpful friendly people. Boarding was equally efficient. The flight attendants worked hard to deliver genuine service and nothing was ever a problem. This was my 5th and 6th flight with Delta Air Lines this year - I have been trying them after consistent issues with AA. Based on this experience I will be using them more often. They seem to be working to lift their game.
1669,2,3,October,2017,Economy Class,"Cedar Rapids, IA "," Tampa, FL ", Atlanta   ,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ," Terrible customer service. Delta allows you to book a flight for a certain day and time and will then change your itinerary by 6hours weeks to months later, with no remediation if their new flight plan for you doesn't work with all the travel plans you've made. Secondly, they routinely check all rollerboards for zone 3 passengers no matter that there are always plenty of overhead spaces. They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to. In summary, hate that airlines take advantage of customers. Unfortunately, Delta isn't the only one that does this."
1670,1,2,October,2017,Economy Class,Seattle , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  New York to Lisbon, returning Dublin to new York. The price, despite being in summer season, was excellent, especially in comparison to most other options. The level of service was the best we've experienced in many years of travel. It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency. Delta could not have been more supportive and considerate related to this circumstance. Delta has announced in this past week, the upcoming utilization of a system involving in flight wifi free of charges will be initiated in the near future."
1671,2,2,October,2017,Economy Class,Stockholm , New York City      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  Atlanta to Augusta. Once again Delta disappoints in their ability to deliver anything close to the promised service. I know complaining about small planes is played out but in this case I went out of my way to purchase specific luggage that meets all airline requirements and of course none of the provided storage space was as advertised. And to top it off the flight was delayed, again. Honestly would travel any other airline if possible. This has to be one of the shorter flights in the country and still service is poor."
1672,8,1,October,2017,Economy Class,Sao Paulo , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  San Diego to New York. I booked my tickets through Delta.com and there's an options between choosing Main Cabin (couple dollars more to pick the seats) and the regular Economy. Having paid a couple more dollars, I was able to secure seats for my family and me. I received a confirmation e-mail and everything looked good. It would've been the perfect vacation / honeymoon for me and my husband who got married a week before. Delta gave me the worst traveling experience ever. I bought a total of 16 tickets in the span of 2 weeks for me and my family.  I just want to sit next to my husband. I paid to achieve that. I reserved seats 32A and 32B, but when we went to check in, we got seats 35A and 34B.  I paid for a service and didn't get it. I was traveling with my mom and aunt as well as my husband, but because they left half way, I thought I just booked the seats and would've figured out seating arrangements amongst ourselves when we got on the plane. I realized that even though I reserved seats, I didn't get them. Who separates the newlyweds? You can count on Delta!"

1674,1,25,September,2017,Economy Class,Seattle , Amsterdam        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Verified Review ,"  Atlanta to Ft Myers. They overbooked the flight to include my ticket, leaving me stranded at Hartsfield since it was the last flight out back to RSW, and said that I would have to find another flight. Waited at the gate kiosk for 15 minutes only to have them rudely direct me to a delta customer service counter. There, I had to wait for almost an hour and once I talked to the lady she said that since I was an economy customer she could not rebook me for another flight since I had a zero balance available. It was their fault they overbooked and they refused to give service. They said I could try calling the customer service number to order another full price ticket (for $458). Found a way better deal with Southwest for $230 that left at a better time."
1675,1,21,September,2017,Economy Class,New York , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Business,Germany, Verified Review ,"  Los Angeles to Sydney. Delta had a 3x3x3 layout in economy class on this Boeing 777 on this flight from LA to Sydney. I had an economy comfort seat, which features more legroom and slightly more recline, both valuable assets on a 14 hours flight. The seat was comfortable, and I could catch some sleep. The service was decent. However, the food was rather sub-standard. I had a tasteless cheese ravioli dish. At least, I cannot complain regarding the amount of food available: Delta served a snack in the middle of the flight (sandwich, apple, cookie) and breakfast (French toast). Furthermore, they had a snack bar where you could serve yourself during the flight."
1676,6,19,September,2017,Economy Class,Atlanta , Killeen        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale. I've purchased an online ticket and when I get to the airport I was assigned my seat in boarding pass. At the gate i was informed by the agent the flight is overbooked and if I do decide to go on a later flight I will be awarded with an $800 voucher since it was not to late and sounds great so I said yes I'm in, then she took my boarding pass she copied and told me to go ahead and have a she'll call. I was very hungry but I waited till everyone board which was over an hr of course, later she called my name then she gave me a new boarding pass she said go in, like I had no choice. So I get on the plane, after takeoff I grabbed my book and found my original boarding pass with a seat that the attendant just gave a free earpiece to, and I was just charged for one. I realized she had given my seat away to someone else and give me a broken seat. When I point it out to the flight attendant she said there's nothing they can do for me that the flight is full (with empty first class seats of course) however she will send a red code to the counter at the exit, and go talk to an agent when landed which I did - at the counter in FLL she completely ignored me. She had told me to call if I have a complaint she's busy."

1678,3,15,September,2017,Business Class,Cleveland ," Minneapolis, Minneapolis ",Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,France, Verified Review ,"  San Jose to Atlanta. I have seen a lot of service on airplanes, good and bad. This service before the boarding was by far the worst experience in a long time. Online Check In didn't work due to technical issues, no seats available at check in to sit next to each other. Even three hours before. Exit was available but didn't give us without charge. No customer service as I expect. Was supposed to ask at gate, waited 20 Min and the answer was ""No, flight full. Next please"". Very rude and not friendly at all. A good explanation would be fine. Was questioned by employee about visit to Costa Rica without letting me know about the reasons for his questions. Don't recommend this airline. Bad service, rude behavior."

I have to admit having read the reports on this site I wasn't looking forward to this flight but the service was very good, the flight attendants professional and helpful and food/drinks offered were good quality and well presented.

1680,9,13,September,2017,Business Class,Raleigh Durham , New York La Guardia ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Verified Review ,"  Salt Lake City to Raleigh Durham on DL1846. Paid for business class ticket and gate agent gave it away to someone else when I was in the terminal, on my way to the gate (using restroom -- sometimes you gotta go), more than 10 minutes before departure. When I arrived, the gate agent essentially said ""too bad, I can do what I want"" with a big ""forget you"" to a very loyal customer. I guess 650,000+ miles in the last five years doesn't mean much to these guys."

I had the pleasure of travelling to and from Portland with the same cabin crew. They were really efficient, friendly, helpful and informative, not only in terms of in flight support but also useful data and advice re our time in Oregon. Further, despite being very approachable they maintained a highly professional approach. In respect of the food, there was a good range on the menu and the ""hot food"" was actually hot. The only small downside re refreshments was that we were not provided with the usual pre-flight drink on our way back from Portland. Seating and in flight entertainment were fine though I did not find the flatbed particularly comfortable. My thanks to all the great cabin staff( and of course the pilots), for facilitating two enjoyable flights."
1682,10,8,September,2017,Economy Class,Victoria , Washington DCA , Seattle / Atlanta   ,Business,Germany, Verified Review ,"  Had a very pleasant flight with Delta from Atlanta to BogotÃ¡. Delta uses a narrow-body Boeing 757-200 for this flight, which features the same business class as in domestic flights. It has five rows with 2x2 recliner seats. But for a four-hour flight, this is perfectly sufficient. The service was very good, and the food was tasty. Delta usually has a meat and a vegetarian option on this flight. I had a salad, Ravioli with fresh vegetables and a fruit platter for desert. I could not have asked for more."
1683,10,8,September,2017,Economy Class,Chicago , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  We had very good customer service on our recent trip to Tampa! I was worried about traveling in light of the negative publicity surrounding different airlines, especially traveling with a 5 year old, a 2 year old and infant. Allowing us to board first and get settled was very helpful as well as allowing us to check car seats, strollers at no cost. But the best part was when we were coming back and my 2year old grandson had had enough refusing to buckle, wanting to get out of his seat, etc. We were in the very back seat next to the stewardesses seat. A lady sat beside him and held his hand and talked with him, got him cookies and juice, showed him pictures of her children while we were taking off and landing. She was so good and sweet with him! Really made our trip home less stressful and more enjoyable!"

First the planes--thus gates--were switched last minute. Shuttled across the airport and boarded to find that we were delayed because they had to verify the switch (due to a faulty turbo needed for Alaska but not Los Angeles) and because we had too much fuel (again, needed for Alaska not LA). Then because during the now 90 min wait with no air conditioning on a 85+ degree day* we'd used gas from one side of the plane and not the other so it had to be siphoned over. Amazing crew of flight attendants gave us water for the heat and encouraged us to file official complaints. But that 1/2 glass of ice-less water each used up the entire flight's supply. Lots of unhappy flyers, crew, and missed connections."

First leg of the trip was met with a 3 hour delay then for our return flight my one son with special needs was not allowed to check in online, while the rest of my family, consisting of myself and my three other children, were cleared.

Never again."
1686,2,5,September,2017,Economy Class,"Jacksonville, NC "," Fort Myers, FL     ",Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Brazil, Verified Review ,"  A new level of awful. My curiosity got the better of me. Could Delta be as bad as everyone I knew told me it was. I should have trusted my instinct. A clapped out old A330, clapped out cabin design, the seat to be fair was comfortable and I did get a good sleep. Dinner service did not happen as they did not have enough beef to cater for the needs of their business passengers. Sat in seat 4J I was surprised to learn that you need to sit on the ""captains side"" of the plane if you want to get your choice of meal with Delta. The crew member I spoke to was wholly disinterested in any form of complaint and said ""Listen what do you want?"" Naturally I considered approaching the purser on the plane to speak to him about perhaps guiding his staff on how to deal with premium passengers. When I learned a few moments later that this guy was the purser I realised that my night was over and this was a bus service to Atlanta and that I should expect no level of service whatsoever. Looking for good things. The seat, thats it. Bring your own food, don't expect any manners, get on the bus, sit down, shut up and you'll get to your destination in one piece. I spend a lot of my own money flying in a style that I like to enjoy. Delta failed, failed and failed again. I regret that I now have to continue flying on to Paris with Delta. Thankfully this flight is in economy and as such I already have no expectation of service whatsoever."

Being disabled with a broken ankle, I was dreading my flight to Minneapolis. At the gate I was pleased to be helped so efficiently and pleasantly by a personable lady attendant. Upon boarding the aircraft, we were met by a steward  who made us feel very welcomed and was so helpful. During the flight, he and a stewardess went over and above to make my grandson (age 7) and I have a delightful trip. The plane was beautiful- very clean and well maintained. The captain was great about keeping us informed and the flight was on time and smooth! Thank you so much for such a pleasant surprise trip!"

1689,3,31,August,2017,Economy Class,Detroit , Punta Cana , New York    ,Solo Leisure,Italy, Verified Review ,"  New York to Atlanta. Nothing particulartly positive about this flight. The Delta First Class seat looks like a 1990s long-haul business class seat, with the difference it does not recline and there is no footrest. Food selection very limited (sandwich or chicken salad), I took the salad and quality was overall good; beverages selection limited as well and a Chardonnay served in a plastic glass before take.off is something simply meaningless (especially if during dinner proper glasses are used). Crew - like in the previous long-haul flight - seemed a bit too ""casual"", which can be easily misunderstood with unprofessional (I have been more than once addressed as ""honey"" during the flight). IFE very good on such a short flight, with large screen and possibility to use my own headphones. Overall an average experience."

I purchased his tickets from Killeen to Panama City (United) for August 31 and the return trip on Delta for September 4th. Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future. Unfortunately Delta is not that type of provider, so if you are reading this review I suggest that maybe you shop elsewhere just in case (god forbid) a similar situation happens and you are stuck not able to get your money back. I am sure that Delta will be enjoying a very nice self appreciation party on my dime. No compassion or empathy for their customers."

Quite an awful experience on a decrepit Boeing 767-300. Cabin configuration with a staggered 1-2-1, seat itself very old but sort of ok (narrow though). The worst of this flight is the inflight service, seems at Delta they don't take their premium customers seriously; food below par (entree cold, beef fillet hard as a stone); presentation so poor (when you put some warm bread on my tray, why on Earth should you put it on the butter so that it melts everywhere?). Cabin crew attitude too casual for a business class cabin. IFE in such a small screen that some smartphones are bigger; new business class blanket (by Westin) is oddly covered - on the supposedly external face in a very hard and ""plastic""-look-and-touch material which I fail to understand. Overall the service looks more like a Premium Economy than a Business Class, I keep asking myself when Delta will get rid of those old dinosaurs that are B767s"

Flight time was changed to 2 hours before original scheduled time. When we got to airport flight was delayed. Flight was overbooked, took some time to find volunteers to give up seats and then assign seat numbers to the rest of us. Got notification while in the air (we weren't able to receive it until we landed) that our 9.15 flight had been delayed until 2.30. Found out that it was because of a computer glitch that sent crew to other places and it would take that long to get them back. Changed to another flight but that flight was delayed for the same reason. Clerk said this is not the first time this has happened, you should have been here Saturday! Flight was then delayed until 4.30 and eventually cancelled."

The staff was nice, but our pilot was 2 hours late. A one and a half hour flight turned into 6 hours due to a pilot and the weather. Before returning home I got a alert that my flight was cancelled and that I needed to call Delta. There was a 3 hr wait time.  When I called again later, I waited another hour before finally speaking with someone. She stated there were no flights leaving LGA for the rest of the week, and I find that hard to believe. She stated the only flight leaving LGA was at 6 am the very next morning and  there was a possibility that the flight may not even take off due to weather conditions. I asked if I could have credit for a train or a bus at a later time. I understand that tickets are non refundable, but in the situation, I needed an alternative option. Thankfully we made it home safely even after all of the trouble and cutting our trip short."

They use your name when scanning your boarding pass and I noticed they used everyone's surnames. Pretty impressive. Onboard flight attendants warm and cheerful. All flight attendants greeted me including those preparing the galley. Seat was a lie-flat with a Westin pillow and duvet, each individually wrapped. Great selection of movies, TV shows, games and music. Slept for most of the trip but woke for the landing service. Had beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes. Delicious! They also had laksa noodles which smelled good as well. Bathrooms clean and I like the blue LED mood lighting inside. Way to go Delta! The best international service from a US carrier so far."
1696,7,20,August,2017,Economy Class,Atlanta , Los Angeles ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Canada, Verified Review ," Victoria-Seattle-Atlanta-Washington (DCA), Delta Comfort+ class, outbound on 2 August 2017, returning 10 August, using points accumulated with KLM plus $400 in taxes and fees. In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics â€“ Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T on the ATL-SEA return leg. The FA had no idea how the drink should be poured, even though I'd done my best to ask her to (i) give me a cup with a couple of ice cubes, then (ii) give me the little bottle of gin (they offered Bombay Sapphire), and then (iii) let me pour the tonic water as the last step. She kept giving me a combination of ice and tonic water first, for me to add the gin as the last step. My Grandma would be horrified."

Can someone please tell me why when I make my reservations weeks is advance, I am not given the option to select a seat? Then when I check in 24 hrs in advance, they again will not give me an option to select a seat? Then, I have to go to the counter to get a seat even assigned to me. Then, when I request an isle or a window I am told (with a sarcastic laugh) no due to it being an oversold flight? How again an oversold flight is my problem? I followed protocol and I get punished as a customer. I tried Delta again after a while of not using them due to similar issues, but I am sorry to say it's back to American Airlines for me. I'm sure Delta will never read this and even if they do they won't care, I'm just trying to protect fellow passengers who spend their hard earned money on this ridiculous company. Save your money and fly elsewhere!"
1698,9,17,August,2017,Economy Class,Nashville , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Germany, Verified Review ,  We decided to fly from NYC to Miami return with because we had a coupon from an earlier flight we had to cancel. It was just a small amount they gave us back but we thought it's worth it to use it. But after what happened to us on august 2 we will never book with delta again. Our plane was scheduled for 7:02 pm (August 2nd) but then they kept delaying the flight for 3 hours and it kept getting more. Around 8 we saw that other flights would depart earlier then ours (by that time 12:30) so we tried to check if there were other seats available on other planes ! That was the time when we read that the flight got cancelled! We did not get informed by delta nothing! It was not even on the board. So we went to the gate agent to talk with them but the people we talked to didn't understand our situation at all.  We literally had to beg them to help us. My boyfriend called the number they gave us to at least get a coupon or anything that could help us out. But nothing. Even when I asked them for blankets they got mad. Just because we didn't want to accept that they are allowed to treat us like that just because the flight got canceled due bad weather conditions in New York.  Now was the time we gave up hope and decided to stay next to other people sleeping on the Floor waiting for our flight to depart at 11:10 am! Which means we spent more than 16hours at the airport waiting to fly to Atlanta before we finally got the chance to fly back to New York. In Miami we ended up sleeping on a bench. But the benches there are the hardest I ever sat on so it was pretty much impossible to sleep. I swear that was the first and definitely the last time in my life I fly with delta. Unbelievable - I don't know where the humanity went!

The people I talked to on the phone had great service. Counter was a different story. My family had a 4 hour layover in Vegas. We asked for boarding pass so we could go out to grab a bite. They guy first said he couldn't until an hour prior to our flight. We had to explain why we needed our pass before he printed our pass. While doing this he made a couple rude statement, ""how many people do you have? Making me work"" are they not here to help? Next time I'll make sure the person is having a good day before asking about my seats. After all said and done everybody is sitting alone. With a group of 14, five are kids. After a second third time talking to him we finally got the kids together. Forget that we checked in early to try to get seats together, forget that we booked together. Next time I'll fly with someone else."

The prior 3 reservations were all late, I missed my connections and had to wait hours for the next plane. The last straw was today 8/14/17. My son is in the military and is coming home on leave. Delta decides to delay a plane with approximately 25 people for 3 hours because ""a flight attendant got lost"". So needless to say, my son missed his first connection, now will miss the second connection (and last flight to Florida by the way) and now has to stay at the airport until the next flight after 8am tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, that is how Delta rewards our men and women who serve in the military."

I am a Diamond Medallion, almost 2 million mile flyer. I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for â€œmeet and assistâ€ help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare â€“ my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off. As a passenger asking for help I hoped they would step up. I am hugely disappointed in their lack of response. Apparently loyalty is oneâ€“way only."

Arrived 3 hours early for connecting flight after our KLM flight from Amsterdam. Due to huge line in immigration and security and hardly any staff raced to gate to board for Miami but they closed the doors already. No accommodations, no apology just rude attitude from gate agent. No calling passengers names and flight left missing many passengers from the wait line. Have no idea if luggage made it or not and freezing cold lying on floor amongst all the dust and construction noise. Very unpleasant situation. The KLM flight was little late departing as waiting for late passenger to board and announcing them several times. No such courtesy for us and no courtesy or help at all."

1705,1,8,August,2017,Economy Class,Paris , San Francisco , New York    ,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ," Delta have adopted Spirit Airlines as their business model but they stand behind having room and space for people to operate in, which is false. The service workers are as good as they can be but the policy makers have put all these folks in a bad spot cramming tons of people in tight spaces. Boarding and exiting the plane is unorganized and difficult. Delta are a bad choice if your flight is over 90 minutes long. Leg room is non-existent, even in most of their preferred seating. Long lines in just two bathrooms areas from NYC to San Francisco. Will not be flying Delta anymore."

My flight has been delayed until August 6th 12h00 pm. The aircraft had a mechanical problem which would be supposed to be fix up during the night. Because I was in transit, I didn't havethe right to go out of the airport to the hotel that was offered by the airline. I was the only customer in this situation, so they managed my problem by giving me a mattress, a pillow and a blanket, and told me to sleep in the airport. I asked if it would be possible to open one of the Delta Lounge for the night, but I was told that it was not possible. I waited 1 hour and a half for the pillow and the blanket. One of the passenger told me that that it was the second cancellation in 2 days for this flight going to Montreal."
1708,3,2,August,2017,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth , Salt Lake City    ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Austria, Verified Review ,"  Originally supposed to fly Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam. I arrived at terminal A at the airport in Boston at 13.00 for the 16.45 flight. Check-in took longer than it should. I then went to the Delta skyclub lounge and it was dirty. The food was mediocre. You also have to ask an employee for the wifi password. I went to the gate and the flight started boarding at the normal time. Seats were not the most comfortable, even for business class. A crew member rudely forced me to put my passport in the overhead bin rather than in front of me. I never forget stuff on aircrafts! We were just about to depart when the captain told us there was a delay because of a broken air vent in the cockpit that was just discovered. The plane was sitting at that gate all day. Why didnâ€™t they spot the damage when the plane arrived from Amsterdam that morning? First the crew spent 25 minutes trying to fix the vent in the hot sun with no air conditioning allowed, then another 30 minutes talking on the phone with their maintenance HQ, then they told us there would be a delay until 20.30 at night. We were forced to exit the aircraft so they could take it to the hangar. Now we had 300 people with missed connections waiting in line at the help desk with only 2 employees there. The staff acted uncaring and oblivious and many people were getting very angry with them. When I reached the front of the line the Delta customer service staff told me I couldnâ€™t do anything and I was forced to stay on this delayed flight. They didnâ€™t even look at other options! I did not see them look down at their computer screens when I asked them about re-booking. They probably just want my money. They never updated us on the repair progress but the flight was now delayed until 23.00. At that point I wouldnâ€™t make it back to Austria for another 2 days. I called my travel agent and they successfully rebooked me on a 22.15 Lufthansa flight through Frankfurt. It was on time and everything about that airline (lounge and aircraft) was so much better than Delta! I arrived in Vienna 5 hours later than expected. I later found out the Delta flight to Amsterdam was eventually cancelled. Avoid this airline for international connections!"
1709,1,1,August,2017,Economy Class,Atlanta , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  My flight was supposed to be such a short trip, that is why I chose to fly instead of drive from Seattle to Spokane. Both flights were majorly delayed on my trip and it defeated the purpose of flying. In addition to that, it seemed very prominent with the crew that this is a regular thing. When I go onto the plane, the overhead bins barely fit my carry on purse. I had to fly with my carry on underneath my feet. With all the delay and keeping us at the airport so long, you think they would at least hand out pretzels or water. Nope. Terrible schedule and service. I will never be flying Delta again. Should have flown Alaska. They had a Spokane to Seattle flight scheduled for later than mine - that arrived in Seatac before my Delta flight did."
1710,8,30,July,2017,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita , Detroit       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ," I missed my connecting flight with Delta due to an electrical storm. Although that is not the airline's fault, the fact that I had less than 5 minutes to get to my other plane and the crew did not ask for people who were not connecting to wait to disembark so those of us that needed to run could make our connections. Atlanta is a big airport and of course the connecting plane was on the opposite side of the terminal. Once making it to the connecting gate, the customer service representative chuckled when she told the 4 people, that needed that plane, ""yes, that's your plane pulling away"". I slept in the terminal because the next available flight was 9 hours later. Gate changed at least 3 times. I am writing this as I sit on the plane they rebooked me on, supposedly getting ready to go, but actually has sat at the gate with all passengers for over an hour because the underground fuel tanks aren't working. Needless to say, my connecting flight has now been delayed by 1.5 hours. My main complaints are that the desk people are rude and the communication is poor. The airport is dirty."

Both my flights (BOS-LGA delayed from 7pm to 8:30pm and LGA-CHO delayed from 9 pm to 11 pm) were delayed by couple of hours which was fine and understood - but just 30 mins before my 2nd flight (at 8:30 for LGA-CHO) they emailed me that the 2nd leg of the flight will be on time and the first flight won't reach on time for me to even think about rushing and getting to gate to try to make it. Cherry on the cake they did not even wait for few passengers going to CHO and said you are scheduled for next afternoon now via Atlanta - so basically by the time I reach my final destination it will be 7pm of next day. By the way, no apologies at all during the whole 24 hrs process. Will never fly Delta!"

However since there was a 21 D on this plane what difference is that? I was offerred the back row in exchange, no regret, not sorry, so nothing. Then I was told by this astonshing gate man that If I was nice he would not lose interest in helping me. Is this behaviour going to be allowed go forward?"

Complaints sent to Delta for reference to anybody misguided enough to think of flying with them. 3 flights on delta in 3 days, each flight significantly delayed, due to incompetence at a level I have never experienced before, including over an hour to load freight that arrived late, and gate staff posting an hour delay resulting in passengers leaving the gate then scrambling to get them back to the gate. Three flights overbooked, incredible. And to add insult to an already desperately bad service the cabin staff closed one of the two business toilets twice, once after service and once just before landing for ""staff use"" and I was told to either wait 5 minutes because staff have priority or join a growing queue of paying passengers. I will attempt to never fly Delta again."

Flight DL446 was scheduled at 9PM July 13, ended up departing 11:13AM the next day. It was delayed hour after hour, first notification of delay was at around 6:30PM that it was delayed to 10:05PM, then 5 minutes later told it is delayed to 11:15PM, then 12:15AM, 1:02, 1:32, 1:50, 2:30 and finally 7AM (this delay was announced at 2:20AM). I decided to cancel and refund my ticket at 2:30AM and just leave as I was going to Reykjavik for the weekend and it would have been a waste. Thankfully the Delta hotline accepted the refund and told I was to receive my money in one week (we'll see how that goes) and that I had to go to baggage service desk in JFK to claim my bag. I filed a baggage request form and was told that it will be delivered to my house in Manhattan by 3:30PM and that the baggage employees arrive at 5:40AM (I had to wait 2.5hrs at least). I had already been at the airport for 8 hours so did not want to wait. Well, now I regret it. Bag never left the plane and boarded the flight to Reykjavik. Not sure how that happened. On July 14, hotline employee told me that it will board the next flight (DL246 KEF-JFK on July 15). I said no problem and did not mind the wait, and I handled this all calmly even though almost all my belongings are in that bag as I am in NY for a few weeks only. I call again today (July 15) and the bag is still in Reykjavik and employee is not sure when it will come back to NY. Honestly I do not mind waiting but to be promised to receive the bag on a day and then for it not to happen not once, but twice, is very poor customer service. After 8 hours in the airport and cancelling my trip, not having my bag with me is the last thing I would want to happen. Also, every single time I called them (at least 6 times so far), I waited at least 20 to 25 minutes on hold before someone picked up."

You're not getting a hotel because they have none available from their partners! So they expect you to ""hang-around"" for 20 hours after already traveling for long to wait for your flight giving you a 15$ voucher for food! This is the most ridiculous service I've ever experienced. When I summed up the fact that they made me wait in line for 4 hours to tell me they won't help me, they denied ever telling me to stand in the line. Very rude and arrogant staff.

I flown with a dozen or so airlines over the years, and never have I encountered the level of a incompetence and indifference than from the staff of Delta. Not only did the plane arrive 30 minutes late but the stewardesses for the flight arrived an hour past when the flight was scheduled because they were both on separate flights that were also late somehow. Why would you schedule staff to work on one plane when there still in the air working on other plane? This is ridiculous! And this was on a clear summer day, not a winter blizzard. Also, while trying to exchange my tickets weeks in advance because my travel dates changed they resorted to outright extortion. They said they would it cost me $200 per ticket to exchange them for flights that were selling from their own website for $106 each. When I told them that I could just buy new tickets for almost half the price of exchanging them they then told me that they would void my return ticket even though I wasn't trying to chang the return trip. Delta's service is far worse that even the cheapest of the budget airlines. I will never fly with Delta again."

Great idea if only they had the brains to think of this sooner. Now we are finally on the runway and they just realized that the flight time would be longer due to the new route. Turns out we don't have enough fuel. So back to the gate we go. This has been the worst travel experience of my life. To add to it all they ""ran out"" of headphones.

The rest of the crew set a mood of intimidation, unfriendliness and brashness. Not one smile, not one courteous gesture: plain rude. I was very surprised to witness that such service would still exist nowadays: a real horror story. We even requested to talk to the cabin manager to lodge a complaint but Delta does not even have a crew manager on board (or so were we told as they might back up each other). A truly appalling experience."

We have flown with our baby multiple times and purchase her a seat even though it is not necessary until they are two. The flight attendants on this trip flying from Montana to Phoenix via Salt Lake City have been terrible - they are completely rude and have to awareness of how to cater to family travelers. The flight attendants tried to make us check our car seat multiple times even though the manufacturer website clearly shows the seat is airline approved. Also we have a Chico key fit 30 which is one of the most popular car seats sold and I would hope before trying to make us check it unnecessarily they would be up to date on the most commonly approved seats. A child can sit in a lap with no seat so I do not see the issue for what seat is traveled with. After throwing a big fuss over our seat and getting management involved and all the other passengers involved telling them it is approved they finally with disgruntled looks on their faces ""let"" us use the seat as an exception! They acted like they were doing a favor by not having us check the seat when it is clearly approved on the website. I am disgusted to pay for a seat and be treated this way as if they are doing us a courtesy. It is completely ridiculous and needless to say Delta will be our last choice for flying going forward."

That was the worst part. We were promptly notified that there was a technical issue with the plane and that there would initially be a 30 minute delay. After 30 minutes we had to deplane. The flight crew was professional and extremely helpful. As soon as we got off the plane they were already distributing snacks, drinks, coloring books for the kids, and also some playing cards. Throughout the ordeal the station attendants were helpful, even when passenger tensions were rising, they remained professional. They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels. The seats were highly comfortable and had excellent recline as well. There was no seatback entertainment, however, there were magazines provided. I highly recommend flying on Delta, they know how to treat their customers well."

The flight was delayed by at least two hours due to inclement weather which you could understand and deal with but not unprofessional attitude of the staff. Actually it was just one member who proceeded on three, yes three occasions to ignore me while giving out drinks. Once for a cup of tea, again passed over when offering a bottle of water twice! I get that they need to stretch across to take the window seat person's tray but no excuse me, nothing! One other thing  was just before boarding it seemed a little chaotic as people were lining up and did not know which line or where it seemed to be going. The staff were waving you here there and everywhere. Perhaps putting large print signs with more concise info would be more helpful. Though the rating is on the low side, I would recommend this airline as my London to New York trip went fine but return one not so much."

After having a horrible experience departing with Delta back on June 21, 2017, when I returned to JFK, I went through customs and monitored the electronic board for the carousel for baggage. Plane landed at 1:12pm, and at 2:10 the baggage was still not listed. Finally, a number of us started asking various employees who would walk by (almost always not a Delta employee but an airport one), and finally someone said ""The board is not correct. Wait for an announcement."" Eventually we were told the bags had been already out on Carousel 4 (and there were dozens of flights from Delta and other carriers, with hundreds if not thousands of people in the whole area). Disgusting, and incredibly unprofessional. We need in the USA to follow Europe and punish airlines when they screw us over."
1732,1,6,July,2017,Economy Class,Chicago , New York       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  I was on a Delta flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with a connection at Minneapolis. I had a horrible experience. The layover time was 30 mins, which I knew to be risky because it includes the time it takes to deboard a plane. We landed on time (1 minute early) and the race began. A Delta employee gives me the gate number but doesn't tell me that the connecting gate was at the other end of the terminal and would take a 10 minute walk! Regardless, I arrive at the gate before 30 mins (it took me maybe 28 minutes) but I was told I couldn't board because the airplane door was closed. I was not offered an apology. To make things worse, I had talked to a Delta employee on my way to the gate and asked them to call the delta employees at the connecting gate and let them know that I am on my way.  That was the last flight to LA of the day, and I had to sleep on the ground because I wasn't offered a hotel. I took another flight the next day, which fortunately was half empty. Other than the terrible customer service, the plane was clean. However, the wifi wasn't working. We got the standard minimal beverages and some peanuts."

My boyfriend and I will check to book with Delta first for the air excellent choice they give customer's  - complimentary light dinner with 3 or 4 great choices, as well as snacks and beverage choices. We enjoyed the free headphones with a large selection of the latest movies and television shows, each seat has it's own tv. My boyfriend stated he is getting Delta Credit Card to earn flying points as well. Delta, thank you for treating us like human beings and not a cash machine. You stand out from the airlines want to nickel and dime and treat their customers as cash machines instead of human beings."

Cabin crew were friendly, casual but efficient. I was amazed by the retrofitted cabin design and how bright it was. Overhead bin was massive and a carry-on suitcase could fit sitting on the side of the suitcase instead of flat as they normally do. I appreciated when the crew kindly reminded every passenger to get to their seat as soon as possible and move away from the aisle to speed up the boarding process, since we started boarding a few minutes behind the scheduled boarding time but arrived in Orlando 20min early. The entertainment system was very amazing and it's even better than those on long haul international flights. Big screen and a lot of movies to choose from. Free non-alcoholic beverage and snack is a common practice in US domestics flights. I will choose Delta again."

The customer service staff who serviced flight Delta 2414 from Las Vegas to Seattle on 22 June 2017 was amazing. This gentleman was polite and professional and was absolutely funny. I was also amazed that the pilot who was standing at the counter also spoke and joked with customers waiting for seat allocation. This is very refreshing and cool. The special treatment continued on the flight with very friendly flight attendants. The snacks provided on this domestic flight is better than what you get on a premium airline in Australia. I am very impressed with the service from all levels. Keep up the good work Delta. My family and I will definitely fly with Delta again.

Very disappointed in Delta Air Lines  and will be canceling delta credit card. We were delayed multiple times by weather related incident to then be told we would be flying when the plane arrives to then be told the flight was canceld as we waited until 1:30 to be told. Waiting around for nothing when we could have been told earlier and either went home or got a hotel and rebooked. Why wait until 1:30am. No compensation or credit or hotel to stay in nothing. Things happen, but to not be taken care of for nothing is a little absurd. Statistics show that if you stayed at a hotel and had an ok experience you would most likely not stay at that hotel. If you had a bad experience, but the staff took care of and made that experience right you would go back at a much higher rate. If only Delta would have done the smallest thing I would def use them again. I will now try and never use them if I have the chance. Thanks Delta, hello Southwest"

The crew were exceptional. There was a man that needed medical attention in the back of the plane and the crew asked overhead if any nurses or doctors could come back. I am an critical care nurse in Seattle, so both me and my sister (also a nurse in Seattle) went back to help. We spent about 15 minutes back there with the man (who turned out okay), but they took our seat numbers in case he needed any more medical attention. Later on in the flight, a flight attendant came by to take our name, email address and home address so that they could give us each a $100 voucher for our services. I was so touched. Delta was kind enough to not only express their gratitude but to give us a reward. Delta was already one of my favorite airlines because of the quality of the flights as well as the entertainment selection, but now they truly are my favorite airline."

Delta attendants at arrival were very helpful and courteous, our connection at Atlanta was distant, we had to go from terminal C all the way to terminal F and our flight to Honolulu was on time. We boarded an older A330-300, from it's registration number it was one of the old Northwest Airlines aircraft, but the layout of the Business First is the latest Delta product. Delta have an excellent record of their upkeep of their aircraft even if they are very old. The entertainment system worked well but the food was very poor. Again the service was professional and top notch. Arrival in Honolulu was ahead of time and we had a great view of the Big Island and Maui and towards landing we saw beautiful Waikiki."

Flight from Tucson was cancelled delaying trip for a day. On the way back we had 2 stops. Flight from Portland delayed, no reason given. Flight in Seattle delayed, no reason given, which made us late for final leg of trip out of LA. Although plane to Tucson was still on the ground they would not let us board. The airline provided a hotel room. However, it took over 2 hours to get luggage and to the hotel room despite hotel being less than 2 miles from the airport. Returned the following day to fly to Tucson. Gate agent missing, total chaos, and plane left late."
1740,10,27,June,2017,Economy Class,Detroit , Las Vegas       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  I had a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta and connecting flight from Atlanta to Virginia. ""Due to weather"" we were in the air for an hour on which I got left behind from my connecting flight. I got to the gate at 10.30 and the flight was departing at 10.40 and the plane left early. I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination. I am not pleased at all with the way Delta managed the situation. On top of all that my connecting flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale got delayed by 2 hours and no information was given on why it was delayed. Needless to say I will not recommend or flight with Delta again!"

Delta should definitely invest more of their budget fixing their airplanes. Sunday I traveled with them out of LGA and because of technical issues flight was delayed 3 hours, then the excuse was that the flight was overbooked and eight people had to leave the plane. Finally today after hours of delay because of technical issues, the flight was cancelled with no more flights available until tomorrow."

Just got off a flight where the flight attendants talked on the intercom almost the whole flight. And the volume was so loud my ears are ringing and I have a pounding headache. Never before have I been on such an annoying flight where you couldn't relax, rest, watch a movie, or read because of the incessant talking on the overhead announcer speaker about nothing. When we got off the plane, the person I was traveling with expressed the same frustration. The flights attendants need to shut up! I would much rather fly Southwest where you can actually enjoy your flight!"
1743,1,23,June,2017,Economy Class,Honolulu , Singapore , Narita      ,Family Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  Flew Tampa to Raleigh-Durham. Kudos to Delta for going above and beyond. I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option. WiFi was provided though I did not attempt to use it so cannot comment on speed. If Delta continues to provide this level of service I will continue to fly with them."

I am disgusted by the way Delta treat their customers. My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them. We were then told that they had come on an earlier flight. It would of been helpful and customer focused to tell us that in the beginning The return flight was also a nightmare but I am not in mood to go on as it gets me more angry by the thought of it"

At my second attempt to asked whether I could be seated next to my husband the staff member barely made eye contact with me and did not offer to assist with this query.

1747,8,16,June,2017,Economy Class,Atlanta , Miami        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,  Delta continues to be the best of the American legacy airlines. Check-in at Barcelona was easy and the gentleman who printed our boarding passes and took our baggage was very personable and made us feel very welcome. Business class seating was fine and service was efficient and pleasant. IFE was fine and I was able to watch two current movies during my flight.

Efficient boarding, take off on time. Very good food: both meals and ice cream and bottle of water in between. FAs were swift and attentive. IFE with a very broad selection of movies/programs. The only downside was a quite old aircraft with all related issues (loose panels, exposed repaired details, drafts in the cabin), but the seat (economy) was surprisingly comfortable. I think Delta would gain many more credits with a newer fleet on the long range flights. In general very good impression. With 2 points subtracted for the aircraft cabin condition, I definitely recommend Delta for trans-atlantic travel."

The flight was delayed due to a flight attendant being late from another flight. When many of us passengers who were taking connecting flights voiced our concerns about missing our flights to the flight attendants we were ensured that we would reach or something would be done. We arrived in Seattle at 1050 which was approx 30 minutes later than expecting. Due to my connecting flight being on the complete other side of the huge airport I missed my flight, along with many others. Then I was told that although I was supposed to be on a connecting flight I could still get my bags at SeaTac but of course my bags were already at my final destination. It was absolutely horrible!!

As I was flying out of New York to Austin, I was preparing to board when I watched the harried gate agent begin the begging process for anyone willing to give up their seat on the early flight for a guaranteed seat 10 hours later. We were told after the flight had left that we would receive an email explaining the process for receiving our compensation in ""about 30 minutes."" That was Friday - today is Monday - no email. I would think Delta would learn that bad press is to be avoided - but maybe you are functioning on the premise that any press is good press."

My family and I  flew internationally and Delta refused to move us to an earlier connecting flight, despite the fact that we had plenty of time and they told us the earlier flight had plenty of seats.  To make us even more mad, they said ""if it was one of you we could do it, but not for a family."" So, I can only conclude that Delta hates families? Or they're just lazy? I'm mad that I have to sit in the airport for 6 more hours. How is Delta so stupid? Now there are less seats on the later flight to possibly sell, and they just chose to anger five international travelers who have families of their own. Way to simultaneously screw your customers and yourself, Delta. We won't be back. I gave them a 1/10 instead of a 0/10 because the flight crew on our first leg of the trip was great."

On the flight that I got switched to, all the staff were equally as helpful and patient. Delta hires good employees and this counts them as a trustworthy company in my opinion. If you have flight problems, Delta will take care of you well."
1759,1,22,May,2017,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale , New York      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  Richmond to Johannesburg via Atlanta. I was very disappointed with Delta Airlines, I booked my ticket to Zimbabwe on January 28th, 2017 for a trip in May 2017. I purchased separately a Delta Comfort seat for an additional total of $418 because I knew the 16 hour non stop flight to and from ATL to JNB was long. This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away. Now, I was told to take the economy seat as there were not delta comfort seats available as the plane was getting ready to takeoff. I had no choice but to do so. As a delta skymiles member, I was lied to by these agents and was very disrespected. If Skymiles members are treated this way and based on this experice, I will certainly cancelling my skymiles membership and delta gold credit card after being treated like trash. I also will not be recommending delta as customer service oriented airline. In my opinion, Delta demonstrated bad business practice, by relinquishing my comfort seat when it was already paid for.

You should not have to pay extra to bring luggage and to pick a seat on the plane. The lady picking seat assignments was very rude when I was trying to ask questions. Both of my flights were delayed do to Flight attendance not being on time. I will never book with this company again. A 6 hour trip turned into 8. I would have expected better for a company I paid more for.

My husband and I purchased plane tickets for our honeymoon roughly 7 months ago for this flight. We were just married two weeks ago and we have plans to spend a week in the East Caribbean. We purchased economy tickets with Delta Airlines because, as one would expect, we were on a close budget while saving for the wedding. We followed up with check in procedure, signing in to schedule our seating at 4:33pm, 24 hours before our flight. The check in opened at 4:30pm on May 18th. 3 minutes into check in all of the seats were booked. So on our honeymoon we are having to sit separately. My husband then called Delta Airlines and spoke to a representative that stated it was a full flight, and for us to speak to the front desk representative at our terminal for accommodations. We arrive at the airport today and waited in line. After hearing an announcement stating that there are several unassigned seats currently and not to worry, that a seat assignment would be given to the individuals when they board the plane. When we did our check in yesterday we had a choice of 2 separate individual seats rows apart from each other even though we booked our tickets 7 whole months in advance. The representative greeted us when we came up to the desk and let us know that no accommodations would be made for our situation even though it was a special occasion for us. She brushed us off and asked us to please take a seat. I am dissappointed. We recently flew with Delta earlier this year and I was highly impressed with their level of organization and professionalism. We travelled with our family of 14 people and were able to book 3 full rows of seats for our whole family with no issues. I am sad on the first day of our trip that no accommodations could have been made for my new husband and I when we followed procedure and planned so meticulously. We are boarding the plane now."

On way back, left Boise to Salt Lake City, told there was going to be just over an hour delay, I asked at the Delta desk, will I make my connector at JFK to Dublin, was told yes. Left SLC about 30 minutes into flight, flight was told they were doing construction on runways at JFK. Right before we landed at JFK, they made an announcement to the flight to please let ones who were connecting to Dublin off the flight first as we needed to make our connection. Well, there were about 18-20 of us that missed the flight to Dublin by 8 minutes. Yes, 8 minutes Delta would not hold the flight for us. 10:05pm in JFK and we were told plane left, no flight for 24 hours, I asked if they had a motel for us or any food vouchers - anything, we were told as a group, no. Slept on the floor of JFK Airport tell 8am the next morning then spent $60.00 of my money to check into the Delta Club, yes I got to take a shower and eat and rest, but I feel that of no fault of mine, Delta could have made a little effort to hold the connecting flight for 8 minutes or help all the folks that were in the same position as I was for 24 hours."

Seats changed at the last minute. Given worst seats in business. Chief flight attendant did not care. Luckily traveling on KLM ticket from South Africa. KLM crew intervened and got our seats changed. Special meals were not on board despite being present on Delta web site. Typical US airline cattle car service despite being in business class. Seats had privacy only one per window once we got our seats changed. Excellent food and comfort once we took off and had issues resolved. Bonus miles for problems on return from customer service were too little too late.

The seats are very small and narrow. I am not a stick thin model but I am also not a 300 lb. person. It might be a good idea to upgrade the planes and add just a little bit more width to the seats. To spend hours sitting in a very narrow seat is pretty bad. Once we landed, I was very sore when I got up."

Last year at this time we flew Heathrow to Seattle and Seattle to Portland and it was a wonderful experience especially on the way back because at Portland I was asked to checkin my hand luggage and garment bag. The garment bag didn't make it but after a Delta supervisor made a number of calls the bag was on the next flight and our pilot said on arrival at Heathrow he would let us know if the bag made it. To my amazement after a long flight leaving an hour late but arriving on time he told me at the exit that my bag was indeed on board. What fantastic service. I sent email to Delta but never even got an acknowledgement of it. This year from Amsterdam direct to Portland on DL179 we were called back to the gate because of a security issue. Bags on board but not the passengers who owned them? Not Delta's fault. But on a 10 hour + flight you would expect not to have to be reaching for Jerseys, hoodies & gloves to keep warm. Lots of passengers complained about it being freezing for the whole flight (it was colder than the cold water served up). We are flying back on the 22nd and hope we can get some sleep from Portland to San Francisco to Amsterdam then to Manchester, please Delta don't have it so cold."

We've used Delta for international travel many times and had no problems. Internal US domestic travel has been so different. First of all they took our hand luggage off us and told us they had to check them. If we weren't prepared and had a smaller bag each we would of had to scramble and find something to put our essentials in as they didn't care and said there's no room, they need to be checked in. We had a multi leg flight but were told we wouldn't be allowed our luggage for any of the flights even though there might be room on the last flight. The flights themselves were fine, friendly staff and relatively on time. Just minutes late nothing bad. The next night is when we land at Daytona, the last flight and one of our bags doesn't turn up. Luckily an agent was still on site and told us that unfortunately the bag didn't get on the flight at Denver and that instead of being sent to Atlanta they sent it to Minneapolis. The bag is ""hopefully"" going to be on the 11am flight tomorrow which we have to go and pick up ourselves! If not they've told us it's going to be a problem as we are moving resorts everyday as we are on a touring holiday. Sorry Delta but that's not my problem, you ruined our first night in Florida."

I spoke to the customer service agent in Pocatello about a delay notification received. At that point, I wanted to cancel and fly a different airline out of neighboring Salt Lake City. They looked for additional flights, there were no other options were found. Delta agent assured me it would not interfere with original arrival time. I accepted this but after my first flight, my third flight was delayed. I believe it was known originally and they just didn't want to refund my money and have me fly a different airline. Now I am currently stuck in Atlanta waiting on the next flight to Charlotte at noon. This will be my fourth flight. I explained it was my daughters birthday party, which I will not make it to now. I have been at various airports for 24 hrs. I just wanted to cancel and was deterred, lied to and I will not be flying Delta anytime soon. I suggest you choose another airline."

They rebooked and cancelled 4 times my flights. I am still waiting for a refund for the premium economy seats I paid for but was not able to use. Also I had to do a lot of talking before they would give me hotel vouchers for the two extra nights. I had to book a hotel myself. Never saw so many frustrated travellers.

When calling customer service they were very cold and seemed to just be reading off of a script, rather than listening to my frustration.

My experience with Delta has been horrible all around. I used miles which apparently they treat you like a 2nd class citizen which is insane because that means you fly often. I almost missed my first flight out on my connection due to them being late and having to wait for my carry on. They then made me feel bad about it. When I had booked my flight I had to pick an airport 2 hours from home because they were out of my nonblack out tickets. I tried to get my flight switched which they had flights for and they said yes and then changed their mind and said no. Now I go to check in and my flight is running late and I will most likely miss my connection. When I got frustrated they just told me it isn't their fault and I have no right to be upset. Then I asked it they can do anything and they said no it isn't our problem. I will now get home a day later. Terrible customer service. They should be embarrassed they treat their customers that fly with them often this way.
1775,10,23,April,2017,Economy Class,Seattle , Phoenix        ,Direct Flight,Business,Canada, Verified Review ," Flying on Delta today has been one of the worst experiences I've had flying with any airline. My original departure for return started in Brunswick followed by a horrendous stop in Atlanta. Upon arrival at approx 230 pm I was directed to a boarding gate in terminal A gate 17. A short hour later they changed the gate to terminal A gate 31. A short hour later the flight was changed to terminal B gate 33. Keep in mind at no time was an announcement ever made for gate change, the unmanned tv screen just miraculously changed without notice. Just when we thought it was over and by we I mean the several passengers in wheelchairs, and those needing assistance to board, we're notified that 2 mins prior to boarding time they had changed gates again. This time we would have to run essentially to terminal E gate 35. Some arrived approx 10 mins after scheduled boarding including myself to be told that the flight will mow be pushed back because it flew in from Colombia and needed to be cleaned. I approached the gate representative and notified him that my next leg from Seattle was international and that the new arrival time only allows a 30 minute window between arrival time and actual departure of my next leg international to Victoria, Canada. The response I got was priceless and he typed my name into the computer to verify and suddenly looked up with a smile as he said I guess you should run when you get there! While I wanted to laugh I also realized it's probably not a good time as a rep to be making jokes to passengers who have been re-gated 4 times and may or may not make it home to their family on time or even the same day. Professionalism and some punctuality is important if you wish for customers to return and in this case as I heard from the crowd numerous times Delta lost many return customers to include myself."

We waited 2 hours with not even water in a hot aircraft when they announced that the crew was working for too long and they asked us to get off the plane. Only one person from Delta was outside but he didn't know how to explain anything. At the end I left the airport after 12 hours and was not even offered any voucher or transport. I lost one day at the airport. Spent a lot of money with food, transportation, hotel and didn't get paid for the event I was working. Delta offered me $100, which I didn't accept."

I ended up driving from Atlanta to Nashville to try and catch a flight and when I arrived in Atlanta on the 6th at 4am the staff that opened up was incredibly rude. They did not help me rearrange my flight and I went to American Airlines who were helpful and got me home.

I called customer service immediately and they let me know, they booked us on a flight at 8am the next morning! Keep in mind we were catching a connecting flight so we would've had to get hotel rooms for a family of 8 due to their mistake. I was then told my only other option was an extremely reduced per ticket refund because I had already flown most of the way. I dont know about others, but I dont like booking flights for ""most of the way there"". I took their refund and my family and I rented a car from LAX to SFO.

That first statement speaks to my recent Delta Air Lines experience. It started with one of the best flights on Delta Air Lines where I flew from cancun to Minneapolis. The captains of the plane struck up conversation before boarding and were very friendly. When we boarded the flight attendants asked our names, where we were from and treated us like gold. But, then we got to Minneapolis. We asked politely if there were any upgrades available and the gate agent answered the most condescending ""you do that when you book. Who told you that you could come here and ask me for this?!"" I was stunned. Not just stunned frankly insulted and angered. Paying customers should never be treated with such contempt and outright disgust. Delta who claims to put there customers first in this instance treated us like mere nuisances. This will definitely impact my decision whether or not to fly Delta in the future. To make matters worse I saw the same gate agent treating other customers with attitude, contempt and disgust."

The pilot continuously kept us informed, as occasionally there was some turbulence. The stewards very humorous and friendly. My son said after, ""mom I like flying"".

This is the first time that I've flown in a number of years. I don't usually fly with Delta when I do fly, but there were several aspects to this trip which were disappointing. My wife and I went on a missions trip to Guatemala. Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it. We were never offered any drink, and the service/attention we received was no different than in economy - which, in my opinion, was also sub-par. With the financial windfall airlines have enjoyed the last few years, I would expect more - and also cannot understand why they charge for 1 checked bag at all! In sum, this Delta experience was mediocre."

I had a flight from Houston to New York scheduled for today, Monday the 13th, and have been calling to adjust my flight due to the storm since Friday. I was told numerous times that my flight would not be affected by this storm and that in order to change my flight I would need to pay a change fee and the difference. This is completely unacceptable when you have customers being proactive and willing to take earlier flights. I was more than willing to pay the difference in the flight, but no fee waiver was offered. After 4 calls and no help from any customer support representative my flight has now been canceled with no option but to fly out mid-day Wednesday. I am not only losing business but have important job opportunities at risk."

Flight departed on time and arrived about 10 minutes late. Weather was forecast to be turbulent but pilot altered course and altitude to provide a smooth ride. First class flight attendant was first class. Friendly, energetic, and a pleasure to fly with. Service was fast, food was decent, and glasses were refilled. Noticed that wine is now served from a full bottle, which is a nice upgrade. The B757, while an oldie, had a completely new cabin with in-seat power, personal TV screen, and wifi. The wifi didn't work well on all four segments of my trip. Not sure if it is Delta's receivers, traffic load, or the fact that Gogo doesn't support their connection app anymore, but it took over 45 minutes to connect on each flight. (Gogo was great on Virgin America the week before). Fast gate arrival and my baggage was on the carousel at SFO before I made it to the arrivals level. Baggage was priority tagged and handled accordingly, except they ripped off my luggage ID tag. From chocks down to exiting the SFO parking garage was 5 minutes tops. Delta continues to be my first choice for long hauls from SFO, even though a connection is usually required."

The flight from Charlottesville was delayed by 30 minutes, making me very afraid that I would miss my connecting flight in NY as the turnaround was very quick. Made it to La Guardia and ran to the Gate listed on my boarding pass, only to learn that the Gate had been switched. I was never notified and there was no announcement made. The flight from La Guardia left 35 minutes late. Onboard that flight, I was seated in the one row on the entire plane that was skipped for snacks/drinks. No apologies were made, and no one even acknowledged us at all. It felt as though we were intentionally being ignored. All in all, I feel quite disrespected and don't intend to fly with Delta again. There was one flight attendant on the flight out of Charlottesville who stood out for her excellent customer service and great attitude."

Weather mishap, compounded by lack of sympathy and poor customer service. Initial flight delayed 2 hours. Missed connection by 10 minutes. No attempt to get me off the plane (or the other 10 people on that connection) quicker was made. We possibly could have made that flight if we were allowed to exit first. Second, calling help line I asked when the next flight out was, she said ""tomorrow"" and laughed. They offer no protection for weather delays, I was given a toothbrush kit with bathroom essentials after lying on the terminal carpet for nine hours. I purchased a bottle of whiskey and put it in my carry-on in Jackson after checking with airline security that this was allowed. The next day, they actually tried to charge me to check my carry-on or dump the bottle out. Since I bought my own hotel room and left the terminal, this bottle was no longer considered safe. When I asked them to comp it as an ""I'm sorry how poor your flight was"" the check in lady said, ""it not like it's our fault you bought whiskey"" - after asking her supervisor, they comped the whiskey. Poor attitude all around. Never fly again if I can avoid it."

On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta. I experienced a Europe-US flight with Delta last year on A KLM ticket which was a good one. I would definitely consider flying with Delta again if the ticket price is competitive."

It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline. The best part was, after I consolidated, they forced me to check my carry on anyways. She could have suggested that from the getgo instead of making a spectacle of me. The 1 out of 10 stars is for her, not Delta."

Yes, they provide a comparatively cheap fare from Germany to the US, but on both legs (to and from US) technical troubles with the plane (to US: engine; from US: autopilot) led to substantial delays. Badly enough, the information policy on the ground was non-existent (""just don't go anywhere and wait until we board"") and on my way back my luggage was lost at Paris CDG airport and arrived three days later. Even though the Business Class product is not bad considering the price, the planes (old Boeing 767/757's) are run down and the two technical issues described above are certainly related to the fact that this airline strives at still flying 20+ year old planes on main routes."

I booked a flight on Delta.com 6 months in advance and at the time was not given an assigned seat at that time. As the trip got closer I tried to see if I could get assigned seats so I was sure my wife and I were sitting together. I was told that there was a $50 upgrade fee in order to get assigned seats. I fly 2-5 times a year and I thought this was strange, I had never heard of this before on any airline. The day before our flights I received an email from Delta that they had changed the times of all of our flights. We booked our flights at specific times because we were meeting another couple in New Orleans. because of the flight change they were going to have to sit in the airpot for 2 hours waiting for us. When we arrived to check in they tried to bump us to an even later flight. on our connecting flight they did the same thing. On the return flight our plane arrived early but the gate was damaged and we had to be towed to another gate. This caused us to miss our connecting flight leaving us stranded in the airport for more than 4 hours. We had to scramble to make arrangements while going from gate to gate in the airport only to get home well after 12am. A 14 hour travel day. After almost two hours on the phone with Delta's support they offered us a $100 voucher. That was my last Delta flight. There are plenty of airlines to choose from. Why fly with a company that doesn't value you as a customer?"

I had a flight set up for the 12th and was forced to rebook to the 13th due to severe weather. My flight was scheduled to depart at 7am. I got confirmation just the night before, and had confirmation via email as well. I set my rides around this schedule, got up at 4am and headed to the airport. While in route, nearly arriving at the airport, my boarding pass changed to a 7pm flight. I received no email, no phone call and no text. I called to have this corrected and the representative lied to me and told me that the 7am flight was cancelled so they moved me to the 7pm flight without any form of update. Upon checking with Delta, I found that the 7am flight was still on time to depart. I state again that I had already nearly arrived at the airport by the time I got the notice of the 12 hour change. I have never been so disappointed in my life, I was able to have it changed to a 12pm flight, however this should not have been the case. Someone made a very big mistake along the way and I paid the price, not only did I pay the price but no one took accountability for this. Needless to say my frequent flyer miles are now wasted as I will never again fly Delta, nor will I recommend Delta to anyone."

Where to start, we got to Nashville airport with 2 check in bags each (3 of us traveling) and thought it would be easier to check in at the road side counter. The guy there weighed all our bags and then said 'come around this side of the counter and see the total cost for your bags', it was a total of $480 USD for the 6 bags. Now mind you we weighed all our bags before getting to the airport, they were on the limit yes, but he tried to say 1 was close to 60 pound. He then said he would make them all go through for the usual $30 per bag if we 'look after him', so we had to pay him cash (he had a massive amount of cash in his pocket) not so sure if this is Deltas policy. Onboard our leg from SLC to San Fran we asked for a beverage in which we were charged for. We were in Comfort + seating which clearly states on their website and in their brochure in the back of the seat that all drinks including alcohol are free. When asking if this is the case we got a little chuckle and 'argh no mam, no they're not included' and he proceeded to charge us. After re reading the brochure I asked the other attendant who looked at me blankly and said 'yes that's right they're included'. I advised him that his colleague doesn't know this and he has been charging all of us for what's supposed to be included. He had to go and refund everyone one by one. Then to top it off we get to San Francisco airport, get our luggage and my sister in laws brand new Jeep suitcase is distroyed. Literally falling apart. Looks like it had been run over. So off we go to luggage counter and the lady there - while chewing on a lollie - looks at us like we're morons and says 'oh I can get you another one but it won't be a Jeep one sorry'. Well that will have to do unless you want us to carry our underwear and toiletries from San Francisco back to Melbourne. Appalling Delta, very disappointed all round!"

I was on a 3 day trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to meet my family, my sister came from London and brother came from Sri Lanka to meet me. I bought the ticket with KLM, but the flight was cancelled and they reschedule my ticket with Delta. My bags were checked in at Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta and Paris. However, from the beginning, I had bad experiences, at the check in desk two ladies refused to let me board saying that I do not have a valid visa to travel to France even though I produce them my Danish resident permit which is valid for all Schengen states. They simply gave my passport back saying that I cannot travel to France without a valid visa. (I am a Sri Lankan passport holder with a Danish resident permit). I had to speak to their supervisor, and he issued the boarding passes to only to Paris. Enquired him about the boarding pass from Paris to Copenhagen, he said I can get it from the machine once I arrived in Paris. When I arrived in Paris I tried to print my boarding pass, but I was not able to print it due to the fact that they find my flight reservation CDG to CPH. I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket. After 20 minutes thanks to Air France staff they gave my boarding pass. Once I arrived in Copenhagen my baggage did not appear. Then I asked for assistance at CPH lost baggage services to locate my baggage, and they informed me that they have no record after Atlanta. They asked me to contact Delta customer services agents. I contacted them and they were simply reading back to me what is on the Delta website and asked me to wait or either file a lost baggage complain.  As per the telephone conversation with Delta baggage services on Saturday, they said they will deliver the baggage to my United States address as they do not have information regarding my baggage. Saturday the 10th December around 10.30pm they rang me and informed me that my baggage arrived at CPH and they are going to deliver it to my hotel. However, I could not hand over those to him as baggage was delivered to me around 11.00pm Danish time Saturday the 10th December, after my brother left Copenhagen. He flew back to Sri Lanka on the 10th December. I was really stressed out as I had to carry the Christmas gifts back to the US and I have no other way to deliver the gifts before Christmas. Moreover, I have to carry that 16kg back to Denmark next time. I asked them for extra compensation as they ruined my holiday as well as I have to find another way of sending the stuff to my family which I already bought for them. I don't think anyone would spend the US $1200 just for 3 days travel if the trip is not really important. Due to their mistake, my holiday was ruined and I could not fulfil the purpose of my travel.

Delta Comfort seats had excellent legroom (I'm 6'3"") and width (weight 160) and cushioning. We sat in seats 17A/B both routes. In-flight entertainment was OK, but I prefer to watch iPad or do crosswords. Sleep was possible with the recline and own neck pillow, but it was fitful because I dislike sleeping sitting up. Cabin service impressed me. We received two meals, a snack, and at least three beverage rounds (drinks, coffee/tea, juice). Cabin crew were attentive and conscientious. We have flown British Airways and American Airlines internationally on this same route previously and were not impressed. Delta wins. I might add that the Detroit airport was great. We landed about 8:30pm and our flight departed 10pm. Very few people were in the terminal, but most shops were open for water, snacks, etc. It's a modern place."

When I finally boarded, however, the attendant said there was no overhead room left for my carry-on and that I needed to walk back to the gate and check it. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, for no apparent reason. Their policy seems to be to overbook and let the passengers and gate-keepers sort it out.

There were a number of issues on this flight - some beyond the control of the airline. But Delta failed to cater an international flight of over 5 hours duration. There were no first class meals at all and not enough coach meals to go around. Passengers were asked to share which was OK because the sandwich they provided to me was soggy - almost soaking wet and smelled so bad I refused to eat it in any event. Beverages were also in short supply and at the end of the flight as a first class passenger I was offered a choice of Diet Coke or tomato juice only. According to staff the plane should have been catered for the return flight in Atlanta and that did not get done. Flight crew advised that they had asked the terminal staff in Bonaire to make an announcement that if you wanted food or drink you needed to buy it before boarding. If that was done neither myself or anyone I talked to in first class heard the announcement. Flight crew promised that Delta would have a representative at the gate in Atlanta to do something for our inconvenience - that was a pipe dream. Due to the delays I had to run to clear customs, immigration and make my next flight out of Atlanta - also in the first class cabin but with no meal service. So I had a 12 hour travel day with a soggy, inedible sandwich and two bags of chips. I am a frequent business traveler and I avoid Delta whenever I can because they always lose bags, have issues with departure times etc etc. My first Delta flight since 2011 shows they have not changed their stripes."

However, upon trying to redeem said e-credit I was given a very thorough run-around. Two days of multiple phone calls and numerous lengthy hold times and I was even disconnected instead of transferred, which led to another hold. Finally, I was assisted with redeeming my e-credit but only to find out that it didn't even come close to covering the cost of flying NM to CA (this was a credit from NM to Iceland!), and furthermore, the flight times and number of transfers was atrocious (8 hours of travel time, to go 3 states away - 8 hours).

We were reassured at Heathrow that rebooking would be taken care of. There was no further information at any point other than vague and empty reassurances after which we had to wait in a queue for immigration control for one and half hours. By this time I had a migraine and felt very unwell from the stress of the entire situation. After another queue at re-booking queue of 30 minutes were we told that there were no further flights for the day and we were booked into the Holiday Inn South Hotel, and provided with food vouchers for an evening meal and breakfast. We lost a day of our holiday as a result. On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States. We then arrived at re-booking and had to wait a further 30 minutes to be told that we had been booked on the next flight which was leaving in 5 minutes and that we should run to the boarding gates. We pushed our way through the security ran all the way to the shuttle train, down corridors and up escalators and got to the gate to be told the flight had gone and there was nothing they could do. We were given a voucher to stay at the Ramada Plaza hotel. We did not have any hand luggage as this was checked on the flight but we were told we could collect an overnight pack. The queue for this appeared a further 30 minute wait so we headed off to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to queue for a further 30 minutes before being allocated a room for the night. We were told that food vouchers could not be provided as this should have been given by the staff at the airport. We order some food which arrived at 1.00 am in the morning which we paid for using our visa card. As a result of the delays my husband has had to take a day's leave due to the delays."

I am getting no reasonable assistance from Delta Air Lines to assist me in locating my bags and making sure they get to me in Ukraine. The level 1 and 2 agents in Customer Service and baggage are refusing to own this situation, and pretty much just reading back to me what is on the Delta website. I am now resorting to Social media so hopefully someone outside of the @Delta customer service organization sees this and will reach out to me to assist. I am so dissapointed with the customer experience on this issue. I am a loyal Platinum member who takes brand loyalty very seriously and do not expect to be left high and dry this way."

I have used Delta Air Lines on countless occasion, flying over 100,000 miles on military orders easy. This may be the last time. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to make me care enough to write a review. The service from the flight attendants is typically very attentive and they do what they can to accommodate you. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music etc. (when the screens are actually operational) and the seats are not unbearable. My issue is with the airlines lack of accommodation when they have a failure to notify the individual that their flight was cancelled and lack of ability to rebook a flight that is equivalent to the one that was paid for. By missing my flight and not being able to reach the deadlines that are required makes me look unprofessional and weighs heavy on my position. This flight definitely put a bad taste in my mouth in regards to Delta Air Lines, unfortunately there was not any attempt to reconcile the issue."

Delta Air Lines messaged early morning about a flight delay which was appreciated. Flight had been oversold and when checking in online I was offered the opportunity to volunteer. Flight was completely full including a large bulldog used as a ""comfort dog."" Cabin crew was somewhat senior but gracious, in the aisles to assist passengers as they boarded. Service began quickly and the welcoming attitudes continued with flight attendants engaging with passengers as services were offered. While there is nothing specific to tag as having made the flight good, it just was. Everything - food, entertainment, staff availability, even the seat - was comfortable. Delta economy class service outshines their SkyTeam partners and this flight was a perfect example."

We booked on Expedia and a day before the flight we got an email reminder showing our seats, etc. We had booked our seats so we were sitting together. Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, we found ourselves sitting in middle seats in different rows. I explained that my wife was pregnant with morning sickness and it would be great if they could at least switch her to a seat in the aisle. But both the girl at check-in and the guy at the gate said they had no seats for us to change to and that we couldn't upgrade. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""sucks for us, but if they have a full plane then there's nothing they can do about it."" The really upsetting thing is that after boarding we saw that there were many seats open just a few rows in front and behind us. Luckily there was a couple sitting next to us that had been similarly split up and we ended up switching with them so we could both sit with our spouses. I don't know what the deal with Delta seat selection is, but given that they couldn't even accommodate my pregnant wife when there were so many empty seats made this our last Delta flight ever. P.S. I found crumbs on my tray table from the previous flight. Also, the touch screen for my entertainment was broken (It responded to about 1 out of every 10 times I touched it)."

Three of the four flights were inordinately delayed, not because of weather which I would have understood given the season, but because of mechanical problems. The departure time from Milwaukee was constantly pushed back -- to an extent that we missed the connecting flight at Minneapolis. I was assured when the first delay was announced that we would make the connection with the new timing. This happened a second time. We were willing to cancel our tickets and take flights on alternative airlines. But the gate agents were not able to be honest about the actual departure time -- in fact, they said they were only the messengers of the news. In the event, we lost the entire day travelling and reached our destination so late that we had to arrange for alternative transportation because we had missed our previously booked non-refundable transfers -- not to mention the holiday activities we had planned that afternoon and evening. It started our holiday on a very bad note. On the return, early morning flight was delayed for mechanical reasons. However we reached Minneapolis in time to connect. But the connecting flight after travelling down the runaway, gathering speed, suddenly braked and returned to the gate - mechanical problems. An alternative plane was arranged and we reached home several hours later. The ground manager asked us to rate them high for having arranged a replacement plane -- what gall! When you have 3 out of 4 flights on the same type of aircraft of the same airline experience mechanical problems, we have to be very concerned about the maintenance standards and competencies at Delta Airlines. Unfortunately, on many routes we have to put up with this airline as there are no alternatives."

What a difference. Delta's seat were so hard, I thought I was setting on the granite. Cold, old and hard! Food was awful. Service, I can't understand why people pay their money to fly Delta.

As a Stage 4 Breast Cancer patient they literally made the start of 2017, a start I will not forget! On January 2nd my friends and I were set to board a Delta flight from Chicago to Paris where we had a layover before getting to Dublin. I made Delta aware two months prior that I needed an accommodation made to have a seat in Bulk as I had just finished chemo in September and my oncologist wanted me up moving and stretching throughout the flight. Unfortunately, upon arriving to check in, I noticed that this hadn't been done, but explained my situation to them and they kindly placed me in an appropriate seat.  Prior to boarding my name was called and they had decided to move me into business class. In addition when they found out I was flying with friends they moved their seats up to premium economy, so that I would be able to easily be able to walk up and down the aisles and talk with them. Throughout the flight the staff checked on me and my friends as well. Delta Airlines has a Breast Cancer Research Foundation and  this is the first time that I've actually seen a company represent the Pink Ribbon so well! The staff didn't have to care about my situation or consider my friends in the mix, but they did and the fact that they made this flight what it was to me, means absolutely everything!"

Departing flight was fine, Delta spend a few more bucks for better food, refreshments, and bottled water was generously given out. This made a 13 hour flight more pleasant. The downside was the arrival at Guangzhou on a China Southern Airlines domestic flight, had to depart plane only to get herded into a stand up bus, then to door to get luggage. It was hot, and after a 26 hour flight time makes one grumpy. Return was fair, food was fair. Real downside was a delayed departure from Beijing to Detroit and then boarding the plane in Detroit to Minneapolis to be treated rudely by attendant for being late after I practically ran from getting my luggage to go through customs then to the boarding gate. The late departure was Delta's fault, faulty equipment. Several times I have witnessed passengers treated this way going to Minneapolis on the night flight."

When my turn arrived, I asked for help. The guy told me to go to a different desk to get assistance. When I got there the lady told me I had to wait in another line or if not I could call a number.

We are in seat 1C/D, and there is no legroom whatsoever, I just walked back to coach, and the first seats in coach have more leg room than our seats. Our seats recline the same as coach or less, maybe 2 inches at that. This is not worth the money, better to sit in emergency row exit in Coach. We had to wait for about 20 people who said they needed ""more time"" to board the plane before they called first class, and most of the people who lined up to get on the plane first looked absolutely fine to us.

I said, Sir I know but I don't want to have to wake the women sleeping next to me and I really didn't feel well enough to get up and walk around at the moment. He repeated his statement about the tissues in the bathroom and walked away. This was the general attitude if we requested other things such as headphones we offered to buy for $2 (which they said was the price) but they never came back. My family has worked for Delta for 20 years and I have always favored this airline but as a paying customer traveling with my family this year this was a flight that certainly lacked respect and customer service which was incredibly disappointing."

I have never experienced such a nightmare travel experience. Of the 4 flights we took, including connecting flights, every single plane was delayed or changed last minute - not even related to weather. I spent more hours in airports and on phones and in lines with Delta customer service over this 10 day vacation than I ever care to again. And the compensation for the first leg of the flight was minimal and wasn't even offered until after several hours on the phone and we had to make the request. Delta was the only airline with lines longer than space available for lines on both legs of the trip, so clearly it's a consistent and internal issue. Unapologetic customer service, late to connecting flights, missing entire days of a vacation stuck in airports. Not where I'd like to spend my money ever again."

When my husband attempted to choose our seats and check in, he was told that my seat was on standby. I immediately began to panic. He called the airline to correct the obvious mistake, only to be told that we needed to upgrade to premium seats that cost an added $60. We had no other choice since our original seats had been given away. As we were about to board, the attendant said that our seats were not premium. We ended up in economy as originally assigned, plus we were out an additional $60. We were economy on the way home also. This experience was stressful. I cried, not knowing multiple times if we were going to actually have a seat that had been guaranteed months before! I will not fly this airline again since they were unapologetic and offered nothing to compensate our stress or the extra money that we paid to guarantee a seat."

I volunteered to take a later flight because they overbooked my original flight. The gate agents offered a $400 travel voucher to people willing to fly on a later flight. I volunteered and the gate agent told me he booked me on a later flight that day. My original flight ends up being about 1.5 hours delayed and at the end of boarding for the earlier flight the gate agents called my name up to the counter. At this point, the earlier flight is taxiing away from the gate and when I get up to the counter the gate agents have no idea why I'm up there. They had literally just called me to the counter and then didn't know why I was up there. Of course this concerned me so I wanted to verify my flight details for later that day. The gate agents had no idea what I was talking about. They had not booked me on that later flight. I had them book me at that point and verified with them I would still get the travel voucher. The gate agents assured me I wold still get the voucher. Of course, a couple weeks go by and nothing shows up in my Delta account so I submit a request. I finally get a call almost 2 months later from someone at Delta headquarters. She let's me know that, ""there were empty seats on the earlier flight and there was no way the gate agents would have offered me a voucher. Since I didn't get booked on the later flight until after the earlier flight, there was no way my story was true."" This entire experience was ridiculous and I will never volunteer to change flights ever again and any chance I can use United instead of Delta, I will. Everyone I talked to was nice, but almost patronizing, like there was no way my story was true. This was a very frustrating experience that has been time consuming."
1844,2,20,December,2016,Economy Class,ZRH , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States, Verified Review ,"  I was taking what was to be a simple flight from Phildelphia to Chicago with a quick stopover in Detroit. When I landed in Detroit (before 8am), I saw that the flight had been delayed by an hour. This was not a bad thing, given that my original flight would have been boarding by the time I landed and I needed to get from an A gate to a B gate. That flight landed, deplaned, some crew arrived and got on board, and we are waiting, and waiting. They told us we were waiting for a First Officer, they had no idea where he was but hadn't shown up. So while we waited, the crew for our flight timed out. So, they send us a few gates down, where we waited for a flight that was coming in from Minneapolis. This was delayed, then delayed some more, then mechanical issues, then for two hours they told us the plane had pulled away from the gate, but hadn't taken off yet. From what I can tell, the plane never did, and I am not convinced there even was a plane coming. So, at around 3 something, they move us yet again from a B gate, back over to an A gate. Here, the gate agent told me there was a 5:40 flight, but that this flight was scheduled to take off at 5:25, so I should stick with that. All things were looking good (9 hours later) to get this 5:25 flight out. Plane lands on time, plane deboards, some crew get on board, and we are all eagerly anticipating geting on and getting home. Then they start delaying us in 10 minute incriments. Now, while it seemed like some sort of sick joke, the announcement comes across that once again they cannot find a pilot or the first officer. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The horrible realization was creeping up that time was of the essence and I likely was not going to get home that day for no good reason. There was one final flight out that night at 8:30. I went to customer service, where she was anything of customer friendly, but I finally got one of the last two seats available on that flight. She told me I had been switched to the 5:40 flight and missed it, which I had never been told happened and had been given a boarding pass and seat assignment for the flight I was standing waiting on. She accusingly said, ""Well here you go Stephanie, if that's even your name"" as she handed me my boarding pass for the 8:30 flight. Not the slightest bit of an apology as I had been stuck there at this point for 11 hours at nobodys fault but Delta. My time is more valuable then a box of snacks and sack of food from Wendys that were tried to buy me off or passify me. I eat organic, gluten free foods, so that wasn't helping my missed work or hunger. Of course no vouchers were offered, as Delta doesn't offer that, nor was any comfort provided in the Sky Club as I was told that was a different branch. All in all we took off a bit after 9pm after being stuck in Detroit for 13 hours. Some may try to say this was a case of winter weather. That is a lie. This was poor planning, negligence, poor service, and a cheap airline that has no consideration for it's customers well being. I travel 60% of the time for work and for the most part am the decision maker on my travel. For the last year and a half I have purposely stopped flying Delta because of too many flight delays, cancellations, and the worst customer service."

Upon arrival we learned they did not even update our luggage for the revised booking and I had to keep following up to ensure they made the updates. I could go on and on about the worst flight experience of my life but in summary, Delta does not care about their passengers.

We have never flown Delta before, but decided to try them because they are an Alaska Airlines partner. Check in at SFO went well. The First Class cabin flight attendant was surly and not what I've experienced on other airlines in First Class. She was rude and unhelpful. Also on a flight over two hours they're supposed to serve you a meal - they never served us a meal. On our return flight I read that in First you have two free checked bags and the third bag is $25. I'm still looking on their site as they were trying to charge me $150. The website is poorly done and very confusing. I went to Delta checked bags under Delta Airlines and I'm still trying to find it. The customer service was rude and unhelpful when I asked for a supervisor to come and assist. When I explained that his website was not very good at telling me what the baggage fee was he walked away.  We were on a full fare First Class ticket and I have never encountered more rude people than I did on these two flights.

On the return trip home, I was on time, but their plane was not. By the time I arrived (once again in Atlanta) there were only seven minutes to catch a connecting flight. I sprinted through the airport to arrive 3 minutes short. The answer from the sarcastic Delta representative - they may be able to place me on standby for a flight leaving in a few hours, but I should probably start checking out hotels. Nice! I am disappointed with their poor logistical planning and lack of professionalism. To top matters off, my suitcase was damaged. If you want to arrive at your location when expected, try another airline! Just because I'm flying into Orlando, that doesn't mean I want a Mickey Mouse operation getting me there."

Liked the overnight stay in Atlanta in Holiday Inn, following day was promptly picked up from hotel to airport. Overall satisfied with Delta hospitality and sensitivity."

The travel went without a problem from the check-in to getting our luggage. I appreciate the level of consistency in the service. All personnel were professional and efficient. Airplane was clean and comfortable. Food and beverages were better than average and more than sufficient. The flight attendants were attentive and the pilots kept us informed. This is the standard I expect from Delta and I am rarely disappointed.

Most of the trip was just fine other than one terrible person at the gate. She was rude and downright inappropriate towards me and my family. I have never been treated so poorly by a supervisor! This woman needs extensive customer service training and because of her alone I am unlikely to fly Delta again. Other than that woman, the food, seats and basically everything provided by Delta was poor, but that is to be expected in economy class. The rest of the ground and flight crew were mostly cordial. My flight did land on time, and I have no other complaints"

There was 1 hour delay at FSD due to air traffic according to the pilot and I arrived at MSP too late for my connection. Delta rescheduled me for next day flight but my trip was already ruined due to the delay. Delta stated in MSP that the delay was due to weather which was not true so that they do not have to refund me. Another Delta passenger had the same experience as me who was from a different city. They made me pay for the hotel overnight. I also cancelled the whole trip but they could not tell me even approximate of how much credit I received for cacelling rest of the trip. Delta basically lied about why there was a delay and cannot provide even basic customer service. I will avoid this airline.

This was a good flight with one bizarre and inappropriate exception. First, the positive. Great friendly efficient staff on the ground and inflight. The overhead bins are the largest i've ever seen and for the first time ever in Hawaii the priority tagged luggage arrived first and in record time. In addition, the Kona ground staff were at luggage claim offering bottled water. Here's the bizarre twist. The first class meal offered was a cold processed sandwich with 3 slices of apple and a Saran wrapped cookie. The wonderful cabin crew was embarrassed and had no idea or explanation. I have flown this flight at least 20 times in the last few years and a hot meal was always offered. This is a 5 hour flight with a 5pm departure in a first class cabin. In addition for a while now Delta has been the only carrier offering wi-Fi between the mainland and Hawaii. Although the aircraft was equipped the service was not available. Again, the flight attendants were as mystified as myself. I thought the new aircraft was an upgrade from the 757?"

Looks like we will never get to Cancun where we are to have medical treatment for my wife.

I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard.  Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing."

I often fly AF-KLM and Delta was a very good surprise! I flew Delta on 23 October and my seat was 29F. Check in was fast since I was connecting in Amsterdam from a flight from Brussels. The aircraft was a 767 in a 2-3-2 layout. The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy. What came as a very good surprise was the meal and beverage service. We had a choice of 3 different dinners (one being vegetarian) and they came with an entrÃ©e, salad, cheese and dessert. We had a mid-flight snack in a small box and a pre-arrival sandwich. We also had ice cream. Beverages were served often and each was given a bottle of water. Coffee was good and wine and beer was complimentary. I beleive this was of my best economy class flights ever, better than Air France for sure. On the outbound flight, I had seat 10c on the Detroit-Amsterdam in an A330. Great legroom and worth the money. The ticket cost me â‚¬460 return and that inlcudes Comfort class from DTW to Amsterdam @ â‚¬89 one way. You can't find cheaper for Bru-Amst-MSP-Chicago-DTW-Ams-Brussels, and luggage was on time and no complain with my 15 kilo carry on either. Great experience and very kind staff."

I'm actually sitting in Seattle Airport (not on our original itinerary, but I will explain) waiting for our flight back to Calgary. So, our first flight was from Calgary to Salt Lake City. Get called up to the front desk, turns out they overbooked the flight and I was the lucky overbooked passenger. So, my boyfriend and I agreed to get on a different flight to Seattle, which would get us to Sacramento an hour later than we intended (which isn't too bad). We land in Seattle and they change gates in a different terminal right before the flight. We rush over, plane is delayed an hour. Get on the plane, they inform us of an engine leak. Fix that, say we are on our way. About 40 minutes later, we all get back off the plane. To end this quickly, we are still in Seattle but now waiting for our flight to Calgary. As university students, going on short trips is something you save for. I lost not only a planned weekend (hotels etc) but an entire day at an airport we were never supposed to be at. All due to overbooking. However, I will say that all staff was sympathic and as helpful as they could be. Today was awful and so was this experience.

Well we flew out early at 11.24am! Then we got to Atlanta and all went to hell. Delta offered us 1 seat (split us up) on the next early flight not 2 (1 for each of us) so we asked if there was any other way and they said nope, nothing we can do. I asked about our checked bags and was told they would stay here until we depart at 9.20pm, 8.5 hours after landing. At 5pm I got an alert that my luggage was at my final destination while I was still in Atlanta. So after going round and round with this screw up on Delta's end, I'm about to get on the 9.20pm flight with no luggage and not even an apology from them.

The meal that I had ordered was grilled chicken with a barley salad that included dried cranberries and walnuts, excellent meal.  My husband had the sliders with fruit salad and potato salad, and said that it too was excellent. The movies were abundant and a wide variety. No complaints whatsoever. Now for the flight out of Minneapolis on the CRJ, the overhead couldn't hold a carry on bag with wheels. Unbelievably tiny, the seats were in good condition, but I was so unconfortable. They should retire these planes or make the overhead bins larger because my carry on fits in every overhead. When we arrived in Rapid city, our bag was the first to come out. I'll let you know if the return flight is as good. Just make sure for a CRJ flight, your carry on is small otherwise, check it in, that's why I gave this a 9 out of 10."

We barely made it to the gate after going through TSA etc. We arrived in CVG before 3pm (even earlier than we were supposed to leave from FLL). So, I want to commend the quick thinking of the staff who was at the check-in counter at FLL. Also, during the flight to CVG we were given fruits and drinks, not once but twice.

Because of this failure I missed work, so I missed a paycheck and I eventually bought an Alaska Airlines ticket to ensure I would make it home. I get that mistakes happen but in Atlanta where my biggest delay was we were repeatedly mislead by the staff. 20 min delays turned into 2 hour delays but every 30 mins someone would tell us it was almost boarding time. At least be honest about the situation. Then when the crowd would get understandably frustrated one fellow reminded us all that is was a ""long day for them"" and ""they were all tired too"" - excuse me? You are getting paid right now to do you job. I am losing money by the minute while you are just a half hour away from your house. Just horrible customer service. I got 2 vouchers for $200 each was great. Fortunately these vouchers will allow me to attend my friend's wedding in Jamaica. However, I come to find out after weeks of planning that I can't apply both vouchers for one trip. That's a huge let down as suddenly a ticket I thought would cost me $200 will now cost me $400. I call customer service thinking this will all get cleared up. Wrong. They inform me that they can only apply both vouchers if they honor a new ticket fee of $800 - so what good is the extra $200 off if you then raise the prices? I tried to explain to the rep that this didn't make sense and she informed me their was nothing she could do, told that's just the way it is. Horrible service at every turn.

AVOD was satisfying, movies included some classics, some new releases and a nice selection of non-US films with subtitles. Good mellow-music channel too. The ground and inflight staff were competent, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, which is my usual experience with Delta personnel. I am not a foodie, but I was not impressed with the catering. Perhaps too high expectations, given all the hype about celebrity chefs and the fancy menu. The first courses (starters, soups, salads) were great, the entrees were barely OK. Likewise the desserts.

On the next plane we had to wait for 1:45min because it needed to be refueled, and the refueling people forgot to close the cap on the gas tank - so that took time to be resolved. I must say the crew did an excellent job dealing with all the issues. But I am very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. ATL is a major Delta hub, so how  they don't have an extra plane in case of an emergency?! Also the fact that we were kept 3.5 hours on termac was awful! It is inhuman to keep people on the plane while trying to fix it. The fumes that eventually leaked from flooded engine were suffocating us, all while we were told to hang on tight and wait until they figure out if the pump works. I know I do not spend time in my car while mechanic is working on it, so why the passengers had to stay on the plane while having mechanical issues. By far this was my worst experience flying, and I travel a lot. Overall I am greatly disappointed with how Delta handles its business when planes are facing mechanical issues.

Although the A320 on this three hour flight is 18 years old the interior is completely refurbished, including panels and overhead bins. The seats are new and very comfy. Every seat has a power outlet. Even the lavatories are completely refurbished. Then came the meal. Glass glasses. Nicely patterned table cloth. Bamboo looking non-slip trays. Copious amounts of delicious food presented in an elegant way. Great red wine. Wonderful service. Add to that the great onboard free streamed entertainment system titled Online Delta Studio, which you can access on any of your devices, and an internet connection that actually works. I'm so impressed with Delta right now for this is an airline I despised, and rightfully so, for having some of the worse onboard experiences. But if they can maintain this experience and keep it consistent throughout all their flights, I'm ready to convert. An actual 5-star experience on one of the US legacy airlines. Never thought Iâ€™d witness the day."

We got to airport at 3:30 a.m. only to find out our flight said it was delayed until 10:00 a.m. Called 1-800 number right away, was on hold for 25 minutes. We asked if they could rebook us on another flight that morning. After looking things over our flight was actually showing decommissioned and no other flights scheduled to replace. They tried to see if any other flights available and then asked if anyone was at the Delta counter and told me to talk to them. I hung up and went to Delta counter and basically they couldn't explain to me why this happened but stated they could see if there were any other fights available. They kept asking me if there were still 4 of us flying, I said yes this is our family vacation so all 4 of us were going to Mexico. There were no flights available but they could possibly get 3 of us out that day and the other person out the next day. I told her that would not work, so the only other other option was to leave the next day. I politely said I knew this wasn't their fault but wanted to know why Delta would cancel the flight without making other accommodations for the passengers whose flight schedules were now messed up. I was handed a Delta card with the 1-800 number and told me to call them. I indicated I already did. This was a huge ordeal as I felt Delta was of no help for something they created. Long story short, in order to fly out that day I had to purchase additional tickets with American Airlines. I went back to the Delta counter spoke and said I was able to get tickets with American and wanted to cancel the ones just booked. She said that was fine but that would also cancel our return flight. I indicated that was unfair as the flight going to was the only one affected, but was told this wasn't how it worked. I had to call the 800 # with my travel agent and tell the story again to find out if I purchased the tickets with American if I could keep my return tickets with Delta. She said yes I should since this was Delta's fault, she told me to go to the Delta counter and let them know. I told her they were not helpful and basically told me no. She placed me on hold came back and stated she got a hold of Delta and all was confirmed, return flight was still valid and cancelled only tickets going out. My travel agent is trying to get those tickets refunded from Delta since I basically had to pay twice for tickets to Mexico. Ridiculous - shame on Delta."

It feels deliberate that they make it so difficult to let customers share any complaints. 11 hour flight delay for foul weather conditions that don't exist and they don't even offer a hotel voucher when they can't provide the service that was paid for.

I called the number for Delta and talked to a helpful agent who was able to get us on stand-by for the 1:00am flight, since our previous, 12:45am flight had been cancelled. When we got to baggage check-in, the staff made sure that we could get on the flight without being on standby. The flight left late however, so we did not make our connecting flight in Atlanta.

The plane was overbooked, so no changing seats. The seat divider could not come down because his leg was in the way. It was an 11 hour flight having to cuddle with a guy in the seat next to me.

I am becoming increasingly disappointed with Delta Air Lines, and the travel process in general. 1) Customers should be asked for their height and weight/whether they will physically observe more than one seat, upon purchasing a ticket. As an American female of average or under average height/weight, each time I am seated next to a large person it frustrates me that I am increasingly limited into an already insufficient space. I try my best to be tolerant but it frustrates me that I am paying the same amount of money to have someone's body mass spill over and occupy a portion of my seat. It's uncomfortable for me and embarrassing for them. Either make them buy two regular seats or one first class seat. 2) I understand the temperature of the plane has a purpose, but when I am still too cold/uncomfortable when wearing two sweatshirts, a jacket, jeans and a blanket, you need to turn the heat up a little. 3) Stop overbooking your flights. People aren't paying to get bumped out of their seats. 4) My flight today was delayed 4 hours and I am missing one of the events that I specifically purchased this ticket for. I was also told there was no way to get on an earlier flight. This is ridiculous. In all my years of flying, I have never had such an issue on any other airline. Your CEO states that Delta strives for ""unparalleled quality"" (or something to that effect). My experience has been far from it."

Upon arriving there, I was told I should have filed in Atlanta so they can't help me, but here's a phone number.

The lavatories walls are so narrow it would be very difficult for anyone over 190 lbs to manoeuvre freely. Not only are the lavatories almost half the size, the space has cut into the galley so that now you feel terrible standing in the way of flight attendants with no where to stand that is not inhibiting either other passengers or the attendants. The staff were warm and friendly, but they too confessed these updates were difficult for them becuase they can no longer even see when passengers request assistance or have questions from their seats. The call lights are too low on the overhead space for attendants to see and there has been zero adjustment on leg space and comfort for passengers. In addition there was no inflight entertainment on a 5 hour flight. After this terrible experience, I have now been struggling to return home to Los Angeles from my work trip to Louisville, due to Delta's system crashing, their apparent logical response to the thousands of passengers stranded is to prolong and cancel even more flights putting the issue off. At some point all these people are going to have to fly home, cancelling more flights due to overcrowded scheduling is actually making the problem worse. While I have time to afford not going back to work immediately (since I haven't been able to get home yet and this is now the third flight I've finally been able to snag a seat) there were dozens of military at ticketing with no flight options out so that they could arrive and report for duty and training.

Last time I experienced a 6 plus hour delay and they kept reassuring us ""it would only be a little while longer"" then they cancelled the flight altogether. No offers were made at all to make any passenger feel better about their service, just a rebooking. Today travel was going smoother, I had a two hour planned delay and I asked a Delta rep if they could put me on a near empty flight that had seating available and left an hour earlier. I didn't even have a checked bag. I was treated rudely by Delta staff and told it was a $50 up charge even though I had no baggage and I explained my previous poor experience. You would think they would want to help a little at no cost to them. The Delta staff didn't care and didn't even offer to attempt to ask anyone what could be done. I'm not a rude passenger, just hoping they would help me out to have a better experience this time. I own a small business and I think it's a shame when a company becomes so large that common sense and courtesy to customers cannot prevail. I would be appalled if my employee treated my customer this way. I will be interested to see if Delta cares enough to contact me, if not, there are other airlines I can use for my business travel for me, my employees and my family.

All the flight attendants spoke Spanish and they assisted elderly and young passengers. The flight departed a couple minutes prior to scheduled and the captain kept everyone informed about the flight. Once airborne the flight attendants served us a sandwich, pretzels, cookies, and a snack size snickers with a beverage. This was good since the flight was a short international flight.

I overhead a conversation with one stating she had been flying for 44 years, the other responded that she had ""over 50"" years on the job. Cabin service was atrocious - rude, uncaring, thrown at passengers with an angry glare and snatched away. When the purser was asked about a menu item she responded with, ""how would I know? I haven't looked."" Beverage refills were non-existent - even when I asked for another glass of water the attendant working my side neither acknowledged my request nor made any effort to fulfill it. A frustrated passenger finally asked the 50+ year attendant if she could hear him as she kept ignoring him and she responded loudly, saying just because she's German doesn't mean she doesn't speak English. There was no warmth or welcoming feeling on board - more of a challenging, ""us versus them"" sensation. Food was good, flight was on time - but staff service unacceptable."

Flight information indicated an LA arrival of 10:20 pm, versus the originally booked ETA of 9:50 pm. No big deal. But, the way they staff handled boarding was so disorganized that we left much later than the (already delayed) ETD of 7:40 pm. It was like herding cats with many people being left with no overhead storage space. I was fortunate to have boarded with zone 2, but it was incredible how many carry bags and back packs that could easily fit under the seat in front of passengers wound up in the overhead. Thus, quite a long delay doing last second checking of bags. The pilot made up time and it was proudly announced we had landed in LA at 10:04 pm, roughly 10 minutes later than the original schedule. But, then we sat on the runway for two hours before finding a gate at the Tom Bradley International terminal. So, it appears our flight was sacrificed to avoid backing up other flights. We exited into the terminal (after midnight) to find (literally) wall-to-wall people waiting on flights. A serious mess. Then the long walk with our bags to get to a domestic terminal to pick-up our shuttle. When we were getting ready to exit the plane, the pilot came over the PA with a less than sincere, meaningless apology. This airline is horrible! The consequences for me were that I got home 3 hours later than I should have, after 1 am. But, other people on my flight had serious connection issues. Just terrible and unacceptable.

My flight from Las Vegas to Minneapolis was delayed one hour because they overbooked it. This delay set in motion a series of missed connection that made me travel for 2 days to my final destination! I was supposed to travel from Minneapolis to Paris but we were one hour late because they took of one hour late from Las Vegas. Not only that but when I arrived at the gate in Minneapolis they closed it 20 minutes prior to departure (the cut off time is 10 minutes) and forbade us to get on board. I'm pretty sure they ovebooked that flight and gave away our seats or sold them. It was 15 of us about 3 or 4 families with children and old people but they didnt care.They treated us like animals and called security on us when we asked to talk to the person in charge. Then they told us very dryly to go to the help desk where actually nobody was actually help you. They just gave you a phone number and let you solve your own problem so I was forced to stay on the phone for over one hour to try to rebook my flight and repair their mistake. I had to spent one night in Minneapolis and the next day they flew us to Salt Lake City where I had to spend 8 hours in the airport; the flight to Europe was delayed again 3.5 hours so by the time I arrived in Europe I missed my connection again so they rebooked me on a flight to Paris from Amsterdam. That plane too left one hour later than scheduled and my final plane had another hour delay to my final destination to Bucharest. All in all I had to change 5 planes and it took me 2 days and 4 hours to get to Bucharest from Las Vegas traveling with 3 minor children and a 72 years old. This is by far the worst airline I ever had to deal with and I will never fly Delta again. They were extremely rude and unhelpful, didn't care that it was their fault; they would lie to our faces that they are aware of our delay and we were already rebooked on a different flight.

For the second flight we flew on a brand new A321 aircraft, the captain telling everyone it was the second day in service. The seats were very comfortable in Economy class and even when the person in front reclines you lose very little space with the way these new seats recline. The flight was only 85 minutes and it was turbulent for most of the flight which caused the staff to stop serving drinks before getting to us.

We arrived at McCarran International Airport almost two hours prior to the scheduled departure time. My party had already checked-in online so we printed our boarding passes at the self-serve kiosks, and then dropped off our checked luggage. Once that was complete, we went through TSA/airport security, where the problem arose. There were eight people on our booking, however two of the boarding passes had not printed correctly, with the barcodes only printing halfway. As such, the boarding pass was unable to be scanned, and we were told to print out new boarding passes. We ran back down to the ticketing counter, had our boarding passes reprinted by an actual employee of Delta Airlines (not at the kiosk), and went back to TSA, only to find that this new boarding pass would not scan either. Again, we had our boarding passes reprinted once more, and again, it would not scan. The TSA officer stated that the issue was that there was no â€œdestinationâ€ stated on the new boarding passes. We then had to go back downstairs to the ticketing counter, retrieve our original boarding pass with the faulty barcode, and bring them all back up to TSA. Only then were we allowed to pass through airport security. We reached the gate 4 minutes late, and were not allowed to board, even though the cabin doors had not been closed. During this time, our friends who had successfully passed airport security had been explaining to Delta Airlines employees at the gate, however they received no help from them. The Delta employee at the gate stated that all he could do was put us on a waiting list on the next Delta Airlines flight, which was already full, and that we should contact other airlines for a new flight. What was even more frustrating is that there was a delay, and the plane did not leave the gate for a further 20 minutes! I have sent two emails to Delta, and over one month later, am still waiting for a reply - I'm not holding my breath."

I tried to call reservations multiple times over the past week. I had delays of 40 min to 2+ hours. Most time I could not get through. The space under the seats in the First/Business Class cabin on the B737-900 ER has been severely reduced. I do not know about the economy section. There are 3 black boxes under the seat and a 120 V plug. This makes it impossible to store anything under the seat ahead of an aisle seat. The space has been reduced in the right to left dimension and in the top to bottom dimension. In addition, the Boeing seat struts are poorly designed so that there is little space for the aisle seat under the seat ahead & there is dead useless space. In effect the under-seat space is divided into 3 compartments for the aisle seat. The 1st photo shows from right to left: the bar by the aisle, 1st black box, metal seat strut, 2nd black box.

I said you are going to put me in a hotel for 2 days with no food. All I hear is I am sorry. She found a flight on July 3rd at 10:30pm. Then, they had to make another connection from Amsterdam to Kiev Ukraine final destination. I arrived at 0030 July 4th. I had a lot of family wondering where I was. They waited 12 hours for me.  Maybe combining Air France, KLM and Delta is too much for 1 airline to handle. I was very disappointed with Delta."

After several terrible experiences that I personally had made in the past my family now got to experience the extremely poor customer service of this airline and its total disregard of its customers. My family came to visit me in CO from Europe, travelling Munich to Denver via Atlanta. After massive delay they arrived in Denver with 2 bags missing. We were assured the bags will arrive at my address the next afternoon. We had plans for that day and couldn't do anything but wait for the bag delivery. The bags finally arrived at midnight. One bag was severely damaged the other one completely destroyed. The pieces of the bag and its damaged and broken content were delivered in a plastic bag with a handwritten note that the bag was run over by a truck. We filed a claim with Delta online and received a confirmation email that they received our claim. After two weeks of no further emails from Delta we called several times to be updated on our case and how to proceed. Very poor customer service, extremely unorganized. Finally we were told that it will take 4 weeks for Delta to review the case. No apologies or anything. My family's vacation thanks to Delta wasn't the most pleasant experience. I will never fly this airline and never recommend it."

When that time almost arrives everyone's curious as to why we haven't started boarding yet. They then announce mechanical issues, departure pushed until 4pm. 4pm arrives and the new part has been flown in from Atlanta. Delayed again. Around 7 or so we board the plane. Waited on the plane for another hour, then the captain announced that our flight will not be leaving Jamaica that night. They failed to properly install the replacement hydraulic. So we go back inside the airport, which is now closed. No more flights leaving or entering. They put us in a hotel which took forever (shuttles included). Many hard working adults had to miss work the next day which is unacceptable."

Staff theree organised by boarding pass for SYD-MEL on Virgin Australia. while I had cold glass of orange juice in their 'lounge'. Whisked through security with a minimum of fuss and went upstairs to the lounge. That was modern and spacious with enough variety in the beers, spirits and wines. Lounge had shower facilities, Wifi was very fast. However, the food on offer is far below what is available in the lounges in the TBIT. Boarded about 20 minutes late then sat for an eternity before takeoff. Left LAX an hour late which we did not catch up on the 14 hour flight which was probably due to head winds. Meal after takeoff was poor so I left it and went to sleep. Lie flat beds are ok, if a little narrow. Pyjamas, two pillows and a great duna provided me with the creature comforts and enabled me to sleep for ten hours. I had seat 9A which was tucked away in the back of the first section. It seemed to be more private than the other seats. As mentioned in my earlier review, I am not a fan of the reverse herringbone layout. I'd prefer either herringbone or the more traditional forward seating. Breakfast was just OK. Overall, the whole experience was adequate but nowhere near outstanding."

We had to go through multiple terminals and screenings because of our reassigned flight. We flew to Atlanta and we were told the next flight to Los Angeles was 12 hours later, we even tried other airports and either they had no flights or did not fly there. They messed up our luggage, one made it to Atlanta and the others are still in London. We asked about hotel and meal vouchers through a Delta representative and got none, we were told that they did not do that unless it was Delta's fault because it ""wasn't their fault"" and was claiming it was air traffic control's fault. After being up for 24 hours that was not the answer we wanted to hear. We were compensated at Heathrow by Virgin Atlantic with a more than fair amount for food vouchers just for a little delay. Delta again did not do anything. When we arrived at Atlanta nothing was open and we were hungry. I will never fly Delta again."

However, he was friendly and constantly walked around to see if the passengers needed anything. This Boeing 737-9 was absolutely beautiful with a first rate inflight entertainment. The gate agent did announce that it was one of Delta's newer planes. It looked brand new. Of the major carriers in the US I would rate Delta ""ahead of the pack"".

I haven't flown Delta in a while due to previous poor experiences, this confirmed why I avoid them. Each flight was delayed and on the second flight they changed planes forcing seat changes without giving anyone a heads up until we scanned in. Once the second flight was delayed we eventually switched planes and gates. Not a big deal but boarding after that was extremely unorganized and took about 45 minutes to board a small plane only 75% full. My overall experience is sending me to other carriers regardless of cost."

We were traveling as a family to attend our son's graduation. We booked our trip in First Class as we consider coast to coast a long haul flight, and we like our comfort. Firstly, 4/4 flights were delayed. Delays due to weather, to not having a gate ready to disembark passengers, to long lines waiting to take off, to a faulty fuel cap, to missing paperwork, to delayed arrival of connecting aircraft, etc. Second, the seats in first class are hard as rocks, as well as cramped and narrow with insufficient recline. United gets the edge on this amenity, hands down. On the 4 aircraft we flew on, only two had entertainment systems. Only one of those two worked. On the other two aircraft, you may use your own device to access their new ""Delta Studio"", which offers ""free"" entertainment. However, the only entertainment value in Delta Studio is trying, and consistently failing, to get it to function. The icing on the cake of our tedious journey was on the final leg home. Our flight from Providence to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours, then rerouted off the Eastern Seaboard to a far western track south, causing more delay, bringing us in to Atlanta about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of our last leg home. At the arriving gate, someone told us that if we sprinted, we just might make our flight, which at that point was listed as on time. We actually managed to get to our departure gate at about 10:30, which was scheduled departure. The genesis of the problems we encountered from here on began when we optimistically assumed that the gate agent at our delayed arrival gate had notified the departing gate that their 3 missing passengers were on their way. Alas, he did not. Gate agent at departing gate tells us that he reassigned 1 of our 3 first class seats to someone else, since we ""failed"" to make our flight, and that the only option left was a standby seat left in the middle seat of economy. So, my husband's seat was reassigned during our sprint to the gate and he gets downgraded. We asked if we would receive compensation for the downgrade. We asked if at least my husband could expect premium service in his new seat assignment. We asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight. Staff replies with chapter/verse about ""procedures"". My husband crams in to his middle economy seat, my son and I up in First, when a few minutes later, captain says flight was delayed due to fuel and paperwork."
1936,1,10,July,2016,Premium Economy,DCA , SFO , ATL      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta in my opinion, is the best american airline to fly transatlantic flights. Had a very cheap ticket for my vacation to Italy. On the first leg, I was seated in the very last row, and there was no window where I was sitting. The plane was very full, so I was not moved. The crew were nice and gave me extra snacks and drinks and apologized for the bad seat. The seats were rather uncomfortable, but they were tolerable for the flight time. Best part about the first leg was the IFE. Delta has free streaming from your device, so I was occupied during my entire flight. At JFK, we had a very short connection, of only 51 minutes, but the previous flight arrived 20 minutes early and the international flight left 20 minutes late, so we had plenty of time. Delta terminal at JFK, terminal 4, is nothing special, and lacks food options. The last leg, going to Pisa, was very good. The 757-200 is very good to fly transatlantic routes, and it had a new interior with mood lighting, IFE, and extremely comfortable seats. The touchscreen were very fast and responsive, with plenty of movies and other options. Dinner and drinks came out right away, and the options, the classic chicken or pasta, of which I chose chicken, was very good. Plenty of food and drinks to keep me satisfied throughout the 7 hour flight. I slept for 4 hours, which is a lot for me, I usually don't sleep on planes, but the seats were extremely comfortable. All the seats had USB and AC power, so I kept all my devices charged and ready for taking pictures. Flight arrived 20 minutes early, and all my baggage arrived, so I was very satisfied with this flight, much better experience than what can be found on American or United. Will definitely fly Delta and this route again."

Delta seems to be using a bait and switch booking for their flights. I booked this trip for my 90 year old parent and this is how she was treated. First early morning flight was canceled, no warning after she was already at the airport. Delta rebooked for the next morning. The next morning, the rebooked flight was canceled, again she was at the airport before they announced it. Delta rerouted her through multiple airports. It took another 12 hours to get to destination, so lost a full day and a half of vacation, plus the exhaustion and cost of multiple cab trips to and from the airport. Flight home, checked flight and said on time, got to airport - flight was canceled. Delta rebooked through another route. Got to second leg and connecting flight is canceled, so she is sitting at midnight in the airport, waiting again, exhausted. This makes 100% of Delta flights I booked, canceled after getting to the airport. ."

Although each seat in business class has aisle access, the reverse herringbone seating is a bid off to me. I like to look out of the window but with the reverse herringbone layout, it is difficult. I'd like to see each window seat pointing towards rather than away from the window. Service was good. Food good, cheese and crackers was great. Entertainment options were very limited. Movie choices, television shows and music album choices were all disappointing. Seat was comfortable but a little narrow. Not much in the way of storage space. My phone went flat over the 13 hour flight when plugged into the USB port. I'd give Delta a 7/10 on this flight.

The return ticket business class Amsterdam to Portland was about 4500 euros, which is a lot of cash. For this amount you expect a good service, tasty food, friendly staff and up to standard infotainment and comfy seats. You might feel this coming but unfortunately its none of the above. The service is the part which is most disappointing: its unfriendly, after dinner they disappear and its really up to you to get any drink or food or about 3-4 hour when they appear again to get ready for landing. There is very limited choice of movies, seats are small and don't really flat-out. This whole package might have been good value in 1980 but its really outdated. Would definitely not recommend Delta Air Lines."

There was only one lady working at the desk when there was a line of over 50 people even though there were two other computers available, which delayed the flight by at least 30 minutes. By the time everyone got on board there was a weather warning so each flight was delayed. Finally once the plane had been cleared for take off our plane was number 25 in line for take off. Absolutely horrible service. If the flight staff were aware there would be a delay they shouldn't have boarded everyone an hour and 15 minutes before the plane would even take off. So disappointed."

Flight was delayed slightly (less than an hour) after boarding, but the captain was diligent in relaying the delay and reason for delay. Captain also relayed information about storm systems over Texas upon takeoff. Due to the storm, seat belt signs were on for a long time, but this was understandable. I booked online, and my assigned seat only changed when they switched aircraft sizes well before the actual departure date. Crew offered snacks/drinks two or three times during the 4 hour flight. We landed appx. 15 minutes late. I only had a carry-on so I have no knowledge of checked baggage for this particular flight."

For some reason they had me check in my carry-on, which I thought was weird considering there was plenty of space in the overhead compartments. Checking in my carry-on caused me to be late for my appointment because I had to wait 45 minutes in the baggage claim area for it. Same thing happened on the way back home too, this time I asked to bring my carry-on with me because of my last occurance. They refused to let me even check to see if there was room for it, the customer service was absolutely terrible, and to top it off there was room again in the overhead bins."
1943,1,4,July,2016,Economy Class,DFW , SDF , DTW      ,Business,United States,Not Specified,"Sacramento to Washington National with Delta. I log 40-60k miles a year with DL, not tons but not nothing using several classes (upgrades to F, Y+, Y). While far from perfect, they are the better of the legacy US carriers. On the positive side they seem to be pretty consistently on time, or close enough. I've had tight connections in hubs and never a problem, even though I've had to sprint on occasion. SLC is best, then MSP, DTW. ATL is spotty, LAX is definitely a problem spot. The cabin crew is far, far better on the whole than United. Much more professional and caring, usually well put together. While it's impossible to use miles (like all carriers it seems), they offer decent perks for status. On the negative side, they change their schedule all the time. Like, weekly, but tend to firm up about 10 days out (so more planning than execution). It can be problematic when your tickets come from a company travel service, since you'll need to go through them to re-accommodate. Skyteam coordination is hit-and-miss. Seamless with KLM, pretty good with AF, disastrous with AZ, inexistent with CZ."
1944,4,2,July,2016,Economy Class,MSY , SJC        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Travelled recently on Delta to Paris CDG, opting for the EWR flight as the time was more convenient than the earlier departure from JFK (I was using Delta Sky Miles for this segment). The Delta ""rotunda"" at EWR is actually a near-pleasant experience. For one, the departure time, just after 9pm, means its the last Delta departure out of EWR for the day and the entire security experience to gate was hassle free. The Amsterdam flight departs much earlier, at 6.30pm. The boarding area is standard Delta fare. There is a small Duty Free shop, some relatively tidy bathrooms, and one sports bar in the long corridor that leads to the gates. Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate. Flight push back was delayed 35-40 minutes due to a Sofia bound passenger that didn't board, and the luggage had to be removed from the hold. The plane was a 1991-build 767-300ER, which once flew for Gulf Air. Delta has done a nice job of renovating the interiors and even Economy Class was decent. AVOD was great as was the USB port to charge your phone. Meal service was nothing spectacular, but did the job for what is a 6 hour 30 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient, relatively friendly. Plane was in great condition. Arrived 25 minutes late and was on the curb within 15 minutes. CDG is an awful airport but for a point to point flight, it works."

Everything was fine until I started to board, and then right as I was about to scan my boarding pass, an employee  grabs a tag and puts it on my carry on bag and says, 'all bags with wheels have to check'. I told him calmly that I don't want to check my bag because I don't have any checked bags. He forces the tag into my hand and says plane is full. So I walk down and leave my bag. I was a little upset, but despite his terrible communication and people skills, if it's full, it's full. So I board the plane and go near my seat and sure enough, there's at least three or four places where my bag would easily fit. I tell a flight attendant right away and they tell me that the checked bags have already been stored underneath, so I can't go get it.  Why would he say that? And why not just ask me or talk to me instead of forcing me to do something that is not only obviously completely against my will, but also not necessary? "

Upon entry into the plane it was filthy. Potato chip crumbs on my seat, oily screen, urine all over floor/toilet in bathroom which leads me to believe the plane was never kept or cleaned before our boarding. At 11.43am we were still on the tarmac and they said that something mechanical was wrong with the plane. We then returned to the gate. It is now 1.36pm and we have reboarded the plane. We still have not left. They are saying that they still have no further information. On top of that, the crew have asked us to have sympathy for them. Delta is laughable. I don't have sympathy for the crew. I have sympathy for everyone who has been patiently keeping their cool and have missed their connecting flights and their cruises."

I had a so-so experience during a flight to Little Rock on a Delta partner a few years ago. This time around we flew into DCA. Upon departing D.C., we were delayed by inclement weather to a connection in Atlanta. Even though we selected an alternative flight upon self check-in, we received passes for the cancelled flight. Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning. On other notes, Delta doesn't offer a free checked bag like many airlines. To check one bag is $25. The food on the flight to LAX was overpriced generic junk, think $12 for a wrap you could have bought for $5 at 7-11."

The airline brags a lot about its ability to stick to schedule and pulls one or two tricks to achieve this. We pulled back from the gate within a couple of minutes of schedule but then sat around for an age prior to taxiing. On time departure is calculated from pull back from gate, even if you go only a few feet. Service on board both sectors was excellent with very pleasant and efficient crew. Food offerings on both flights were very good and beverages were frequently offered. Denver to JFK was a midday flight and JFK to Manchester an overnight. Service on both flights was excellent. The lounge at JFK was welcoming and had a variety of hot and cold food on offer. Having eaten on the plane we did not bother with the offerings in the lounge. There is a complimentary bar service (you pay for premium and imported) with a good range of beverages supplemented by tea/coffee machines. The flat bed on both sectors was comfortable, IFE has a small selection compared to many airlines, not a problem for the overnight flight as I slept most of the trip.

1950,1,17,June,2016,Economy Class,LGA , SDF        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"I just spent 12 hours on airplanes and in airports traveling from DCA to SFO and very few of them were pleasant. It started with a delayed flight that would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did receive email notice, but the itinerary was not rebooked. I went to do it myself but was unsure whether or not I could make the earlier flight and so I decided to wait to resolve the issue at the airport customer service desk. Apparently that was my fatal mistake. I arrived at the airport a good hour before the earlier flight's scheduled departure and proceeded to stand in line for half an hour at the desk while 1 customer service rep was struggling to manage a growing line. By the time the other representatives who had been walking in and out of the back room finally jumped in to help, I had tried and failed to rebook myself both online and on the phone, where the estimated wait time was 34 minutes. The representative rebooked me on the remaining itinerary available which was several hours later. After security I then stood in another customer service line for nearly an hour to receive my seat assignment. This flight was also significantly delayed, and even after boarding, we then sat on the tarmac for another hour because of first ""congestion on the runway"" and then ""inclement weather"". I also was asked to check my carry on due to space limitations, and when I protested explaining that I had an interview the next morning and my suit was in my carry on and I didn't want to risk the luggage being lost, the representative literally pulled my ticket out of my shirt pocket to check my name. We were all frazzled, but this really took me aback. By an act of God, my new layover was several hours and the gate happened to be right next to our arrival gate so I made the connection despite the two hour delay (on top of the delay from my original booking). This second flight was also slightly delayed and again I was asked to check my carry on. This time I relented after the representative offered that I remove my garment bag and she would hang it in first class. This rep is the only reason I'm giving a rating above the absolute minimum. Once we arrived in SFO the cherry on top is that we were forced to sit on the tarmac for another half an hour waiting for the arrival gate to open up. I'm not trying to be petty. I'm just legitimately frustrated and exhausted. Customers pay a lot of money for these flights. They don't have to be this painful and they shouldn't be. I'll be avoiding Delta in the future when possible."

The last straw was that after purchasing a ticket from Halifax to Boston in order to catch a flight on Delta from Boston to Los Angeles, this flight was also cancelled and we were asked to wait over 5 hours in Boston to catch a later flight. The Delta agent I talked to had no clue as to why the flight had been cancelled. Delta is the worst as far as reliable flights.

Pre-Boarding in MUC I was surprised by the captain stepping outside the plane and anouncing the flight infront of the whole B-Gates. Crew was nice and welcoming. I preordered veggie food and tasted like it was bought at a Wholefoods market. I have seen better Entertainment Systems with a wider selection of movies and TV shows, but it worked out fine for me and was easy to use. Atlanta serves as the biggest Delta Hub and makes it quite easy to transfer. It is the busiest airport in the world, though, so short connections are usually not reached. ATL to CVG was on a MD88, not the newest aircraft but clean and on time. It was full, so some passengers were offered to check their bags during boarding for free. Onboard service like any other domestic airline, but onboard WiFi seemed to have worked good. When I came to the baggage claim at CVG, my bags were already there, waiting for me. My flight back to MUC was from PHL on the new connection via DTW. Flight from PHL to DTW was on a Boeing 717-200 and delayed by 2 hours due to heavy thunderstorms in PHL and temporary airport closure during that time. Not Deltas fault and they seemed to do everything they could to rebook passengers with tight connections at DTW. Aircraft used was small and again packed full. Again basic service. DTW serves as Deltas second largest hub and is easy to get around since domestic and international Gates from Delta and partners are just across the hall. DTW-MUC again on an old B767-400ER, but with flawless service and nice selection of beers and wines even in Economy Basic. Also love the fact that the B767 has only two seats in the outer rows, which makes window seats even more attractive. Flight was only half full with plenty of room for sleeping. Flight time 8:20 hours with a landing 20 minutes earlier in Munich than scheduled. Based on the experience I will fly Delta to the US again, because DTW seems a good airport to enter US soil and connect to different cities."

The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps. Take every effort you can to avoid DL on this route and the CRJ200 in general."

I do prefer Delta to other US airlines, however. Flew Detroit to Shanghai. The leather seats are pretty nice, as they feel less dirty than the fabric seats can potentially be. The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however. The jumbo jet was among some of Delta's older aircraft, and Delta is planning to retire the remaining ones in their fleet by the end of next year."

Flight was delayed for 6 hours for mechanical reasons. We were told before we left that there would be a hotel provided on several occasions. Once we arrived, we were told that there would be no hotel, but we were free to wait for the next 10 hours for our flight, but they did not know where our gate was."
1958,7,1,June,2016,Business Class,JFK , DUB        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States, Verified Review ,"  New Orleans to San Jose with Delta. Very disappointed and frustrated with Delta. This was the first time I have had such a bad experience flying. I was supposed to arrive home by Monday evening, but the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to mechanical failure so I would be missing my connection. I was rerouted to go home via a different airport, but that flight was also delayed by 2 hours due to weather.  After standing in line for 45 minutes and spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was rescheduled for a flight out the following morning. Delta at least covered the accommodation, but I had to contact my work last minute. I thought the saga had ended when I arrived back at the airport the next morning. I was in for a surprise. I called the central help line to see if I could get my bag checked for free, since I had purchased liquid souvenirs after passing security the day before. The agent on the phone said they would maybe reimburse me, but thankfully noticed that my flight out that morning was delayed by 2 hours. She made a very deft, last minute move to rebook me for an earlier flight out through a different city and I had to run through security to make that flight. Having reached my layover city en route home a day later than expected, I thought, ""I'm finally on my way."" However, Delta had the wrong flight information posted at the gates. I was not aware of the mixup until my name was called over the intercom for the final boarding call. I rushed to the correct gate and barely made it onto the aircraft on time. I was very very upset at this point. I had to conclude that since I had never experienced this type of delay-after-delay-after-mistakes before flying with other airlines, that it must be something to do with Delta. I would not fly Delta ever again. I am now home, 15 hours later than my original itinerary and exhausted from all the stress, uncertainty, and frustration."

Helpful and friendly staff. The second part, however, became a nightmare of pure frustration. We had a 3 hour lay-over in Atlanta and went directly to our gate to wait. We had been told that we would get a seat assigned once there. When the boarding agents arrived at the desk, we politely asked for a seating assignment. We were brusquely told to just sit down and watch the screens. Our name would appear with the seating assignment. We sat and waited -  and waited. Not sure of what was happening. We waited until the clerk was finished boarding one group and didn't seem to be too busy. We again, politely asked how this system worked and were once again rudely told to sit down. Finally, when they were calling for last minute passengers we went to the desk again. This time we refused to sit down. Eventually they found us two seats, one at the back and the other in the middle of the plane. We were the last ones on. I had just settled when the boarding clerk came rushing on board and forced me to move to another seat. By this time I was in tears. It's not as if we booked this ticket as a last minute. We had booked 6 months in advance. I cannot get over the rudeness and inefficiency of the airline personnel in Atlanta. Never again will I fly Delta."

I am a 6.10ft tall, 70 year old senior. Delta switched the aircraft (Boeing 757 N552NW had a diferent configuration from the plane originally assigned for this leg, with fewer comfort seats) and no one warned me. As I got in I asked for assistance from the steward in attendance. He answered he had nothing to do with that adding he would have to be better paid by Delta to deal with such matters. Delta didn't warn me of the change in the seating category and the employee treated me with disrespect. I tried talking to the cabin chief and she offered me a glass of wine to solve the situation, which I refused. I was obliged to travel in a terrible situation."

I just want to say how pleased my husband and I are with the service we received by Delta. Our flight from Denver to Atlanta was delayed by over two hours, so we were going to miss our connecting flight from Atlanta to Newport News. The counter clerk in Denver was very kind, and went to work to see what she could do for us. She found us an earlier flight that allowed us to make it to our connecting flight in Atlanta. Had she not done that, our only other option would""ve been staying overnight in Atlanta to catch a new connecting flight. She also upgraded us to first class, and we received VIP treatment during the flight. Additionally, during that flight from Denver to Atlanta, there was a flight attendant who went above and beyond in making sure we had everything we needed. I was very dehydrated when I boarded the plane, and she showed genuine empathy and concern. She made sure I did not run out of water the whole flight, and asked several times how I was feeling. By the time we landed, I had greatly improved in how I felt! This flight attendant on DL1916, May 16th 2016 was great. I can't say enough about her kindness!"

Flights were all on time, aircraft clean and seating space adequate. Pleased to see the plane was only half full so passengers could move to other seats and I was lucky enough to have the 3 middle seats to myself. Food was ok, usual chicken or beef but could not describe what vegetable was with it, plenty of drink runs throughout the flight with bottles of water offered and nice to be offered beer, wine or spirits for free on the international sectors. Inflight entertainment was excellent with a good choice of latest box office movies, tv shows also available, as on previous occasions disappointed with the music selections available. I like the fact that you can reserve your seats on booking, unlike some airlines who charge for this, or won't let you confirm seats until 24 hours before departure. Third time I have flown Delta and as long as their fares remain competitive will book with them again."

To my horror, I realised that my connecting flight was a codeshare with Delta.  The staff were rude, and the poor management strategies were apparent from a quite empty plane that only offered cramped conditions (with no reclining options) to its passengers. To be fair, I was told that it would cost $50 extra to occupy an empty seat with the extra leg room, and chose not to pay the difference for an hour journey. It seems Delta management have missed out on $50, and confirmed their reputation, and earned a worthy review. The flight was delayed, and only about an hour late, so that was better than expected!"

I am a longtime American Express cardholder, a Delta SkyMiles customer, and a loyal Delta customer who carefully selected my seats the day I booked the trip a month and a half ago. I received a confirmation e-mail noting the seats we had selected as well. When I logged into the Delta website I learned that Delta had moved one of our seats, separating us. This is a very special trip, a 30th birthday celebration, and it is very important that we sit together. The staff treated me horribly, were unwilling to do anything to change the seats, and did not do anything to offer to help. If Delta is not able to retain me as a customer, they are at risk of losing my business."

I specifically told them he needed wheelchair assistance to the gate and onto the plane and the same assistance with deboarding and getting to baggage claim. He arrived over 2 hours early for his flight. When he got to the airport there were no porters or wheelchairs at the curb to help him. When he checked in at the ticket counter the Rep told him that he only had economy seating left and a window seat at that and there was no way to get him an aisle seat and on top of that the Rep also told him they were short staffed and didn't have a wheelchair for him.

Overall a good experience. All flights on time or even ahead of schedule. Transfers at Detroit and Atlanta were easy and smooth. Delta has well organised hubs with plenty of ""Need Help"" centers. Staff is fantastic from check-in to flight attendants, always friendly, attentive and willing to help. Long-haul flights were on an older B767-400, but cabin was modern and well maintained. IFE was good with a wide selection of movies, but only 4 (FRA-DTW) and 2 (ATL-FRA) in German language. Meals were tasty and beverage service very generous on intercontinental flights. Beer, wine and spirits were free, served in the biggest plastic cups I ever got in economy class! Also water cups or bottles were offered by cabin crew every 45-60 minutes. US flights were a bit different. Planes (B737-900) were new, with IFE at every seat. Some movies were free, some you had to pay for (6$). There were a lot of movies available in German language (20-25), more than on flights to Germany. Free drinks and snacks (pretzels, cookies, peanuts) were offered several times, but you have to pay for alcoholic beverages and ""real"" food. Food offers were expensive and selection was rather poor. There is a lack of fresh food (e.g. salad) or hot meals, most offers included industrial food like crackers and crisps. That was the only negative aspect of my journey, in total Delta offers a good product."

Besides the beverage cart pass in the first hour and last hour of all 4 to 6 hour flights, the attendants passed water and/or coffee at least twice. The domestic B767 aircraft was showing it's wear, particularly with the IFE, which worked OK at best, but it was clean and everything worked. The internationally configured B767 is very nice, with new, comfortable seats, a large screen and excellent movie choices (to and from HI they are complimentary). The one weakness was a flavorless Asian-inspired chicken wrap (so-called) that I purchased. I'm not sure why they settle for such mediocre catering."

Customer service on the phone upgrading to Premium Economy was easy. Flight was good, stewardesses were great, extra leg room and seat comfort with the pillow they supply was decent, movie selection was good, watched two going over, three coming back. I have a gluten intolerance and received my food a bit earlier and it was actually pretty decent. The priority check-in, especially at JFK with the shorter TSA line was really nice, the bottled water at check in was just a plus.

Now, even if the policy is inconsistent, you would hope the lounge staff could use some customer-friendly judgement and make an exception to let you in. No such luck at the DCA lounge.

They would give me a call from an unknown number, but if I didn't answer, they wouldn't deliver it. Since I have a job and don't sit on my phone all day, my other option was for them to leave it at the front porch. I don't know about you, but I don't like my belongings just hanging around the front porch all day, so was I forced to take off work. I found Delta's customer service to be a joke when trying to get compensated for my lost wages. You call into one dept, with no managers, only to be told I have to put a complaint through their website. If you wish to follow up, you'll get the runaround. Once you put a complaint through their website, you'll get an email back from a general email stating, ""We don't offer reimbursement"", but thanks for paying $1500, along with the bag fees and inconvenience we caused you, but please fly again. You are unable to contact anyone via phone. Apparently, their corp center with the employees sending these emails, don't have phones. There's no phone lines to their Corp Center, so they can just hide behind general emails and deny people. 2nd time they lost my luggage. I can't understand why Delta is still even around."

Delta has started the policy of making you recheck in at the airport when they've had a ""plane switch."" This means that if you check in online, you'll likely get booted from your seat, even though you checked in before others who waited until they got to the airport, and technically made it easier for Delta. I got booted from a seat that I'd booked over a month in advance for both legs of a trip from Minneapolis to Phoenix, and both times they moved me to the back of the plane (from the front/middle like I'd booked). I have both the Delta app and Tripcase, and Delta has my phone number and email on file.

For some unknown reason, Delta chose to put an aircraft with no power outlets and no USB connection on a 2500 mile route. The seats were hard and had limited recline. The meal service, when it finally came, was appalling. No nuts or pretzels were offered with drinks. The meal had no appetizer, no bread, the portions of the main course were tiny and unappetizing, and the dessert was some kind of nasty lemon gelatto that was half melted. The cabin crew was surly, indifferent, and hid behind the curtains in the galley for most of the flight.  After several hours of no service, one water run was made before landing.

Then we sat on the plane for almost another hour when it was announced due to a fuel leak we would have to deplane and take another plane.

Understandable that equipment changes do happen, but the fact they cannot manage to seat either my wife or I next to either our 5 or 8 year old after repeated customer service calls and subsequent ticketing agent and gate agent visits is absurd. In fact they are comfortable with not a single member of our family sitting in the same row (despite having a saved seats together when the tickets were purchased 6 months in advance thru their website) instead they have seated our children separately 5 and 6 rows behind the closest parent and stated we are welcome to ask those around us if they are willing to trade for our newly assigned middle seats for the 6 hour flight, good luck. Congratulations Delta, you have just lost this family's business for life! I'm confident based on past experiences this situation would never have been handled in this manner by Alaska Airlines."
1991,2,22,March,2016,Economy Class,LHR , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"I flew from Atlanta to JFK on 11th July 2015. As we were about to board the plane at the door (I was travelling with my 14 year old daughter), I was told I had to check my hand luggage into the hold and it would be sent on to my final destination, which was Dublin. I tried to explain that we had packed valuables into our had luggage and other items needed to complete our journey to Dublin. At this stage the staff became quite aggressive and told me to either check the bag or go back up to the gate. Again I tried to explain about we had packed all our valuables etc into the carry ones at which stage he told me I wasn't allowed to get on the flight and to go back to the gate. I had a connecting flight to catch once arriving in JFK so I had no choice to check in the carry ones with all the things inside them. His response was he didn't care what I had in the bags and they had to be checked. I could not believe how he spoke and treated us it was appalling. I spoke to the attendant when we boarded the plane and she said there was still plenty of room and they had not instructed the gate to do this. You can imagine how I felt when we arrived at our seats and not only was the overhead bin empty but wasnt even used during our flight by any other passengers. I will never fly with them again - I have no complaints with the service or crew on the actual flight but I am the ticket agent in Atlanta and Delta's lack of response (not even an email) put me off ever flying with them again."
1992,9,21,March,2016,Economy Class,SLC , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"The service, attitudes, quality and overall experience just gets worse and worse. On my outbound flight from MEM to LGA we were more than an hour late leaving MEM. As a result, we got into weather and air traffic issues at LGA resulting in landing at EWR for fuel. We were 2.5 hours late arriving at LGA. All you get from DL: ""sorry for the inconvenience."" The return flight from LGA to MEM was cancelled. No reason given when I asked two different people. DL tried to put me on a flight the next day rather than rebook me the same day.  I had to jump through hoops just to get out on the same day. Had to fly EWR to DTW then DTW to MEM. The flight from DTW to MEM was almost an hour late because one of the flight attendance was a no-show. Add to that the fact that the seats are terribly uncomfortable (exit row aisle) and the service is non-existent. DL is the king of excuses and ""I'm sorry."" I do my best to avoid them."
1993,10,18,March,2016,First Class,LHR , LAS        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"Delta continues to deliver sub-par service. I fly under government negotiated fares for domestic travel on a regular basis. The ticket booked was for San Diego to SLC on a Delta flight, and from SLC back to San Diego via SEATAC on a delta booked ticket on Alaska Airlines. On the way out, the flight was delayed on departure. No reason was given. On the way back, I ended up finishing early. I called Alaska to try to shift to an earlier flight. As expected, Alaska picked up in a couple of minutes. I attempted to utilize the Alaska Airlines same day ticketed change program to move to an earlier, direct flight back to San Diego, but the relationship with Delta made it so their system wouldn't process the change without cancelling my ticket and rebooking. They told me to call Delta. I called Delta, but was immediately put into the que. Rather than wait I opted to take the call back. It took them more than 30 minutes to call me back. Fail on customer service. When they did call me back, they first tried to charge me a $200 change fee on a government fare. This isn't allowed under their negotiated contract, but I had to argue with them to get them to realize this. If I hadn't known this, they would have tried to shove that down my throat. Then they told me that even without the fee, it was going to cost $200 + to change my ticket due to a difference in fare. Their excuse was that I didn't have a reservation when I had just given them a ticket number. At this point, the conversation ended due to a clear issue with them being able to do their job and me being unwilling to pay for something that would have been free had I booked my entire trip with Alaska airlines in the first place. I recommend not flying Delta Airlines if it is at all avoidable. Their customer service is abysmal and their planes are dated and poorly appointed."

Bought seats in first class, onboard the toilet was inoperable and stank! Cabin crew said they had attempted to reject the aircraft but were threatened by company management. Cabin crew then had to delay food service to allow first class passengers to use aft lavatories. Truly third world service!"
1995,1,15,March,2016,Economy Class,SAT , SJO        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"We will never fly Delta again. We made our reservation for our trip of a lifetime a year in advance. At the time that we made the reservation, we decided to pay a little extra for ""comfort seats"". We also wanted to make sure that there were enough seats available for us to be able to be seated together, then being able to share the joy of our trip. Without notice, on our trip from Seattle to Lihue, where we changed planes, our seat assignment was changed and we were separated. We really wanted to be together inasmuch as we could then lift the arm rest between us and possibly sleep more comfortably. We also felt that as senior travelers, there might be some accommodation for our desire and need to be together. Our concerns were ignored. Now, we have learned that again, our seat assignment for the last leg of our flight home has been changed. We are particularly alarmed that not only was this done without being notified, but also, without any compensation whatsoever offered. Three separate complaints have been filed, all to no avail We have been told that all we are guaranteed is a seat and that our having chosen seats well in advance of our trip has no meaning, nor do they care whether we are senior travelers. They have refused to listen or pay heed to our concerns, and we are livid. Delta offers no such thing as customer service, period. Never again will we fly Delta Air Lines."

Our group of 8 were well looked after by hard working efficient staff. Entertainment worked really well to help pass the time. Would be glad to fly with Delta again.

1997,1,12,March,2016,First Class,LHR , PBI , ATL      ,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Los Angeles to Las Vegas. No complaint about the flight except for no refreshments offered. However check in at Los Angeles was appalling. We had been unable to check in prior to arrival at the airport. There were no staff available to advise where to check in and had to join the Special Services queue. Had to queue for 45 mins and agent was unable to print my onward boarding card for flight from LAS to Gatwick though she printed my husband's. She said that this sometimes happened and didn't offer to try again. On reflection we decided this wasn't acceptable as we would have a short turnround time at Las Vegas but I didn't want to have to join the end of the special services queue again! Luckily managed to find a Delta employee this time who was extremely helpful and printed out the boarding card without any trouble. Very unacceptable experience altogether though especially if we had not allowed a great deal of extra time to check in. I'm sure many people must miss their flights through the queueing system at delta desks at LAX. Would not travel Delta again.
1998,1,9,March,2016,Economy Class,MIA , ATL        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,Minneapolis to Las Vegas and a very nice flight with Delta. Staff was nice and gave us drinks before takeoff. It was my first flight in first class and I didn't know what to expect. Delta provided a very high standard for me. Inflight entertainment was nice too. Good choice of movies and tv shows for all.
1999,10,9,March,2016,Economy Class,PHL , PHX        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I was impressed with the significant improvements in Delta's transatlantic service since the last time I flew them. The 767s, though old, now have personal IFE installed, with clear, sharp screens. Movie selection was good. Catering has improved as well, with decent wines and spirits served (instead of wine out of a box!). The food could be further improved however, and the bagel served for breakfast was memorably bad, rock-hard and cold. Crew were professional, though some of the more senior crew were on the brusque side. Overall, I was impressed on my flight from Atlanta to Paris that Delta's service is finally on par with the European carriers."
2000,10,7,March,2016,Economy Class,BZN , SAN , SLC      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"My wife and I flew Delta from Spokane thru Seattle to Honolulu return and had a very good experience both ways. They ask for 15 people to check their carry-ons because of the full flight. When I went up, she noticed that we were not seated together and move us up to the bulkhead with greater legroom for the long flight. Very welcomed for my long legs. The flight attendants kept us watered and fed and were very pleasant. On the return trip, a similar thing happened, as I noticed we were assigned seats a row apart. I approached the countered and ask if we could possibly be moved to the preferred seats again without paying the $99 up charge, and she said no, but she would try to get us seated together. She came through with the extra legroom seats just before we boarded. Overall, a very good experience."
2001,2,25,February,2016,Economy Class,MGA , LAX        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"There was a 70 minute delay from Columbus to departure. Got to Atlanta with 20 minutes to spare to catch my next flight to Liberia, CR. I tried to ask a question about my luggage to the attendant, she ignored me and the pilot, who was the last one off the plane actually was the one who helped me and said that my luggage would be automatically sent to my final destination. Got to my terminal with 5 minutes to spare, the lady at the desk smugly said the door is closed and the lady next to her could help me. I understand there will be delays due to weather, but I've missed my flight and had to deal with the same issue, being stuck at airports the last 3 times I've flown with Delta. Customer Service is poor. Flying out of Columbus, I couldn't check in using the machine, and the agent was also very condescendingly saying why didn't I use the machines or the other lines. There seems to be a reason why Delta is cheap, and will most likely avoid Delta from now on."

An entire plane of passengers was then abandoned at the airport. Not a single customer service rep was available to help or advise. The worst travel experience of my life."

The meal was ok, we had everything we needed including an IFE with latest movies. The landing at JFK was a bit rough, but no harm done. Would fly Delta again, I would say they are the most reliable US airline at this point."

First thing my girlfriend and I were separated which not a big deal I asked the people next to us and they were a couple and didn't want to move so I asked the attendants to ask some people for me. They asked the couple I already talked to within 10 seconds of me asking, and then just said there is no one who wanted to switch - they didn't even try. After that they told us the WiFi was free which its not. They ignored both my girlfriend and I for food and drinks through the trip. Then I tried to use the call attendant button to which I turned off after 30mins."
2005,2,21,February,2016,Economy Class,CHO , COS , ATL      ,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"I flew with Delta Airlines in Feb 2016 from London to NYC return and the experience was positive. Our check in was quick with no delays and our flight ran to time. Our flight was only about 40% full and it was nice to have the extra space. Flight attendants friendly and attentive. We got given a blanket, pillow, eye mask and headphones. Each seat had a TV with a great choice of recent movies. We were given nuts and pretzels, biscuits, lunch (lasagne, salad, bread roll, cheese and biscuits), ice cream, brownies and cheese and ham bap. We were also offered drinks.  I will be flying with Delta again, thank you for a great experience."
2006,6,21,February,2016,Economy Class,ATL , Raleigh Durham       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,Salt Lake City to New York. Plane was extremely hot and uncomfortable. On the flight to Salt Lake City they kept us on the runway for two hours and ran out of all food and beverages before they even had the chance to service half the plane. Shows very poor planning and lack of concern for customers comfort and well being.

Friendly crew offering excellent service on all flights. Food was of a good quality and very appetising. Onboard entertainment was excellent, lots of movie and TV choices available with complementary headsets on the international routes. Connections were quick and painless and information was clear."
2008,1,20,February,2016,Economy Class,MCO , CMH        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Ireland,Not Specified,Very pleasant flight. Departed from Dublin on time and landed thirty minutes early in New York JFK. Cabin crew was bit rude toward an elderly passenger who was not able to lift her own cabin bag and fit it into the overhead compartment. Cabin Crew said that insurance wold not cover her sick leaves if she get injured by lifting the bag. Breakfast was very poor - only a really hard bread with cheese and a frozen orange juice with yogurt. Ticket was really cheap and my experience was good with Delta. I will fly with them again but the crew should be more polite and kind to passengers.
2009,1,19,February,2016,Economy Class,JFK , BDA        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"San Antonio, TX to San Jose, Costa Rica. A volcano erupted in Costa Rica the day I was suppose to arrive causing my flight to delay twice because of ash in the air. The first night we were stuck in Atlanta and Delta provided us with discounts for nearby hotels and an overnight bag with toothpaste, toothbrush, brush, tshirt, etc. I chose to stay in the airport as the flight was rescheduled really early the next morning. The next morning while still in the air the pilot got word that the airport had not opened as planned so we had to land 4 hours away in the Liberia airport in Costa Rica. This would be a stressful situation for anyone in a foreign country without international calling to contact people back home. But instead of leaving us in Liberia until the ash cleared (which would've been like two days later) Delta helped make the situation easier by paying the fare for us to ride an air-conditioned charter bus all the way to our intended airport in San Juan. The airline was very clear and helpful throughout the situation. The rest of my trip went smoothly and so was my ride back home."
2010,3,17,February,2016,Business Class,MSP , RSW        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Hartford to Ft Lauderdale. First, the flight got delayed at DBL due to the lack of staffing to deice the plane (according to the captain). The flight scheduled for 6:25 pm left at about 8:00 pm. They try to hide behind bad weather (a light snow shower). Second, the connection flight in Atlanta was delayed too. The flight scheduled for 10:45 left at about 1:30 am the next day. They had more than sufficient time to transfer out luggage but they didn't. A real mess when boarding the passengers, the staff do not have a clue how to work. Finally, my bag never made it to Ft Lauderdale from Atlanta despite the large amount of time between connecting flight and their lack of efficiency. My bag was recovered by Delta at 11:00 am and given to a driver to deliver it to me. It is 6:30 pm and my son and I are without our much needed personal things thanks to this airline inefficiency and the people working for it."

No complaints whatsoever about the aircraft, check-in staff or onboard crew. In fact it was a pleasure to fly with Delta - the cabin crew on all flights were friendly, approachable and helpful. It is also nice to sit in business class seats which all face forwards. Entertainment system ok, great selection of films not so for the music. If you are planning to fly with Delta compare the prices on both Delta's web site and Virgin Atlantic's to ensure you get the best deal."
2012,1,16,February,2016,Economy Class,YYZ , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines is by far the worst airline to fly on. After boarding our flight for Miami to Georgia and waiting for over 4 hours, it was announced that the plane would not take off. There were no apologies, no beverages offered and the customer service was anything other than available, let alone polite. Our luggage was lost and there was not one person in sight to help aid us. The lines were horrendous and most others were having the same issues/complications."

I lost my flight - it was very difficult to get help, every time I try to get help the answer that I got was that there was more people on same situation. I got no remedy, no help. I was stuck on the airport for 19 hrs - no one offers a hotel room and I did ask but no meals. It was caused by their own doing and they did not care. I will never take the risks to fly with Delta ever again."

Kudos to the agent at Bozeman for helping me with a lost ID issue. He went above and beyond in getting me checked-in, advising me on TSA procedures and trying to help me recover the ID by contacting the rental car company which opened only after boarding call. He even came aboard the flight to make sure I had gotten my seat and to advise me of his efforts. Also, the flight crews were excellent too. Friendly, helpful and never once acted like the customers were a bother."

Not a full flight and the seats were not significantly larger. If on this flight from Managua to LAX likely won't be full due to odd time of flight (2:02AM). Delta currently flies from LAX to Managua once a week. Great crew and flying experience otherwise. Pilots were super nice as were the crew helpful. Would not hesitate to travel with them again."

Crew were great but from the moment the door shut temperature control in the cabin was all off. Almost immediately got way too hot to the point where it felt suffocating. Then people complained and it turned very very cold to the point where people were bundled in jackets, blankets, whatever they could find. This was in business class. Overheard a flyer in the main cabin mention it was extremely hot. Flight crew said its been an issue with the aircraft they just haven't been able to figure out yet. For a short flight (under 3 hours) it seemed way longer. Just wanted to get off the plane asap. Delta staff were great but this plane needs to be looked at. Also no in seat entertainment which made the time feel like it was dragging on more. Overall bad experience on this flight but excellent on others with Delta. If it weren't for the plane would have nothing bad to say about this airline."

Great flight, super easy and it felt reassuring to travel with a familiar airline to a new country for the first time. As a nervous flyer the cabin crew and pilots were amazing. Sat in 2D thus flight was worth the upgrade, no one sat next to me and the entertainment system was surprisingly updated with a great selection of movies. Meal was surprisingly good (vegetarian lasagna). Watched a movie and arrived in no time. Appreciative to the staff for making such an enjoyable experience."

Seattle - Atlanta, volunteered to be bumped to a later flight for a $500 voucher and a first class upgrade. Flight turned out to be a Boeing 767 with the international business class seats - very comfy with a good cheeseburger and Sam Adams beer for lunch plus a very friendly attentive crew. AVOD had a wide selection of films but was slow to respond and developed sound problems during the second film. Mad dash through ATL from Concourse F to concourse A to catch my connecting flight. Got stuck in the middle seat in Economy Comfort to Norfolk but OK flight. Coming back there was snow in ORF so we were delayed 30 minutes for deicing. Relieved we got out at all. Atlanta - Seattle was a new 737-900. Despite being offered a free Economy Comfort upgrade outbound for some reason I would have to pay $89 for the return trip. Why? During boarding an announcement went through all overhead bin space was taken despite the fact there was clearly plenty of space in the rear third of the plane. This led to a number of understandably irate customers who were forced to check their bags. The economy class seat was cramped and very uncomfortable and the indifferent, rather surly crew (most likely ex-Northwest) didn't help matters. About the only thing free on the AVOD was live TV and the games. Fortunately we arrived on time meaning and end to a punishing experience returning home. I much prefer traveling Alaska or Southwest but this one was for business."

When I deplaned in Atlanta I accidentally left my Kindle in the seat back pocket and didn't realize it until I boarded my next flight. I told an agent in ATL and gave her my information. 4 hours later when I landed, I had a phone call from an agent in TN saying they had my Kindle. A few minutes later they had my address and informed me it would be in the mail tomorrow! I was so impressed by their help and service!"

My mother and I were returning home from visiting my critically ill sister and had a horrible experience with Delta. My mother is elderly and physically disabled. She had a hip replacement recently and needed a seat were the arm rest would lift up. I had my medical alert service dog with me also. They booked us in a seat that would accommodate my dog but not my mother so she was moved a few seats back. I was told I either had to sit with her or she would have to move back to the seat reserved (which they did in error to begin with). The seat I was reserved had more room for my dog. However I had to move - why I do not know. My service dog (which is a large dog) was made to sit in a area where she was unable to move a muscle the whole flight. Delta should be ashamed for the way they treat the disabled. We will never fly on Delta again.

Some were overweight and barged up and down the aisles bashing into everyone's arms and shoulders. Delta should consider keener and more friendly staff. The food was very poor. The one highlight was the Delta staff at Amsterdam. He was tremendous in sorting out an issue we had with an ESTA visa, and we were rebooked at no charge. If all their staff were like him, they would be some company."

Seat reasonably comfortable for a less than 2 hour international flight on packed plane. Experienced staff onboard very welcoming. Check in with ease and courtesy. Security check tedious and lengthy - over one hour at Terminal 4 at JFK due to high passenger volume. Drink service both ways with tiny snack, 2 small cookies or pretzels and soft drinks, coffee or tea. Pilots informative. Barely space for overhead luggage but allowed two unchecked hand luggage. Entire experience far superior to American or United (both dreadful) on this route and equal to Jet Blue (which has more legroom than any of the other 3 airlines which fly New York City-Bermuda). Delay in boarding in Bermuda upon return due to late arrival of aircraft but announcements precise and apologetic"
2024,8,5,February,2016,Economy Class,ROC , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,I booked $1600 first class seats with Delta Air Lines 6 months prior to my trip from Minneapolis to Fort Myers. This was my wedding so I wanted to have no issues. A month prior to my trip I noticed they had put me in different seats in a less desirable location. I contacted them and they explained to me that are not guaranteed. I flew to Florida in the seats I was forced to fly in. The night before we flew out of Florida I checked my flight to see if my flight was delayed. Once again I noticed my seats had changed for a second time but this time I was pushed from first class to coach and I was not sitting next to my wife and child. This was done without notice. I called Delta and explained the situation to them and they were very rude and said we got moved and there is nothing we can do besides switching flights. I have never ran into a airline that is more unorganized or disrespectful. For the amount of money spent to flight with this company I would highly recommend flying with someone else or pay a lot less for the same service.

This type was used on my flight from Toronto to New York JFK. It really looked old inside and out. Boarding was on time and so was our arrival. The cabin crew were friendly and were smiling all the time. Snack was provided and it wasn't too bad. No IFE on this flight but it was okay. I enjoyed the view.

I was right to book Delta Air Lines on my way back to London Heathrow from New York JFK. I checked in using the Delta IOS app - very straightforward and efficient. Boarding was smooth and on time. The cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Other airlines must learn from Delta on this one. Most cabin crew from other airlines talk to you like a robot, mostly closed ended questions which is probably understandable when they are offering food for example. However, not all interactions must be of such nature. The food was great as well as the snacks. It did not look and taste horrible and cheap at all - a call out to Virgin Atlantic. It was a very comfortable and restful flight. I was impressed with Delta on their transatlantic products. I will definitely fly with them again."

The seats were comfortable, entertainment was great with lots of movie choices and meals offered were tasty and plenty. One main meal service and two snacks. Amazing cabin crew provided excellent service throughout the flight, with many drink service runs. The return flight from Detroit to Paris was most disappointing in comparison - with unfriendly crew, after meal service not seen again until an hour before landing in Paris. No drink runs and when I asked about the meal the reply was impatient and uncaring. It goes to show that the quality of the flight can vary according to the crew - what a stark contrast between the two flights!"

The Delta experience was really solid, from the friendliness of ground and onboard staff to cleanliness of planes. I am partial to the A330 because the 2-4-2 seating feels less cramped than the 9 or 10 across seating in newer widebody aircraft. Seats reasonable for economy, AVOD had nice foreign film choices and everything worked. Food was OK at best, probably the weakest part of the experience but not bad. Checking into a Delta flight at CDG was a little puzzling due to using Air France desks. SkyTeam does a great job overall, though, getting Delta passengers beyond Europe."

I last flew a 747 5 years ago, when CX used it quite a lot on the HKG-LHR route. I fell in love with the 747 again, thanks to the amazing Delta service. Their online check in was without frills, very straight forward. When I arrived at the airport in Manila, I was greeted by a battalion of Delta ground crew. They were all very helpful and attentive. One of them carried my bag to be weighed, whilst two of them assisted me with checking in on the self-service kiosks. I was only meant to check one bag (as it says on the ticket), but, they gave me the option to check my hand luggage, which turned out to be very convenient for me. We boarded on time. We were greeted by friendly cabin crew. I always select seats at the end of the plane because from a 3-4-3 configuration for example, the last 3-5 rows will only be 2-4-2. The flight was packed but the service was superb. What I really liked about this flight was the captain keeping us informed in a very transparent and friendly way, and not to mention the cabin crew keeping us comfortable, fed, and hydrated. The inflight entertainment was good. The food was good too. We arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This flight will probably the last flight I will have on a 747. Thank you Delta for making it a good experience."

Seats were comfortable but I got scammed by paying extra for Delta+. We paid nearly $200 extra for a couple more inches of leg room. On the website it shows television monitors and the free entertainment package. There were no monitors and the only way to get free entertainment is to bring your own laptop or pad. I didn't have either thinking there were monitors, so I paid nearly $200 for a couple inches of more leg room. Even worse, on our flight back home there was a couple who asked to move to the seats we paid extra for and they let them move. The attendants were extraordinary, they really made us feel comfortable. I'll say this was one of the most comfortable flights I've taken, minus paying for something I couldn't use because of false advertising."

By the time we got to MSP we were tired hungry and much less than happy. But our last leg helped tremendously. The plane was a newer A319, and the flight crew was gracious, helpful and funny. The flight was smooth and early, and the plane had a great AVOD in each seat which helped the flight go quickly."

The flight down was ok, service was good but the plane was loud and old. The flight back to the US we showed up at the airport 3 hrs early so we weren't late, we had the tickets booked 4 months in advance, we get our tickets and we were seated in row 33 - not having flown a lot we didn't think much of it. We waited in the airport for 2 hours, the plane was late, no big deal. We were patient. We finally go to board the plane and found that there was no window in aisle 33 on an A320. I don't get claustrophobic but on a plane when people would line up by the bathrooms commenting about how bad of a design it was, not to mention that you had to stand in the galley to wait for the bathrooms with 3 flight attendants trying to do their job was just the worst flying experience I have experienced."

They waited until the last minute to cancel flights into Richmond and it was too late to rebook as for two days all other flights were full. They booked us on a flight from Atlanta to Boston and then to Richmond - they said we could go to the airport on Sunday (the day before the new flight) and said we could standby on each flight going to Richmond along with 150 other people and this meant running from each terminal and gate to be on the list. One time I might be 40 on the list, the next 15 and not get out. I called Delta (because no one at any of the counters could help) and insisted on a new flight that day and got to seats out that night! It seems that they had seats available as didn't want to give them up at the airport, poor customer service."

My issue is not that it was cancelled but how it was handled. The flight should have been cancelled in advance but it was not. I and the other passengers arrived and were told the flight was on. We boarded the deboarded due to the weather. Then we boarded again, and deboarded again. It was a fiasco. By the time we got off the plane, there was no way to leave the airport. I was stuck at JFK for 2 days and am now awaiting my overnight layover in Atlanta. Enquired about a voucher for a hotel or meals but was told they don't offer for weather related cancellations. I understand that as a theory but they should have cancelled that first flight. Then I would have stayed in a bed for 3 nights instead of on a chair in an airport with no food, change of clothes or shower. This experience has lost them a customer and I fly a lot."

I didn't have a visa, as I am getting it while I am in Europe. This seems like an oversight on the airline's part, but the people managed to get me checked in with another system. While on the flight, we were informed that since it was a short flight, no drinks would be served in economy (which was annoying). Other than that the aircraft was clean and we arrived in New York on time. The wifi on the flight did not work well enough for me to use the Delta app or Delta Studio."

Pretty sure Delta is the only carrier offering this and only on certain aircraft. Cabin service was very good, although refurbished aircraft layout is odd with premium economy customers in the same cabin as first. What genius thought that was a good idea? Entertainment system was very good and food was pretty good. Seat pitch just barely ok for 6 hours. Lead flight attendant excelled at his job."
2040,8,23,January,2016,Economy Class,ATL , DFW        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Dubai to Atlanta, and Delta continues to lack customer service all around. Cleanliness of plane was not great, food was mediocre, flight attendants are not overly pleasant - rather more of a chore for them. Due to seniority the oldest attendants service the longer international flights, they really should change this model. 9 out of 10 times delta is late for me, gate agents are rude, more so in Atlanta (their hub) than other cities. Delta really needs to invest in customer service and understand the choices consumers have and where they can spend their money."

The first class steward did the very minimum that he had to do. In a 2.5 hour flight he served us a drink with our lunch and we were not offered another thing in the remaining 1.5hours. Not even a glass of water! Also, once I had finished my lunch it was at least 1/2 hour before he picked up my tray. I was just going to use the call button because I needed to use the washroom. I saw another lady in 1C take the tray up to the work area herself. Not very impressed, On the short flight from Des Moines to Minneapolis it was the opposite, in that short 45 min flight even got a refill on my juice."

Once again, my carry on luggage had to be checked. We boarded at 7:20 am and it's 9:5am, and still sitting. The flight is delayed because of the bad weather, reasonable. I am starving, no drink or snack available. I was told that they would conveniently book me on Delta's next connecting flight which is at 5pm. I guess I am traveling for my looks or for Delta's convenience. I was scheduled to be in San Antonio at 1pm."

Although I have Gold status on Alaska, Delta doesn't recognize it for bag check waiver or other benefits. Flight left JFK after we sat on the ground 2.5 hours waiting for de-ice, got in to PDX at 3am. Seats were awful, on a brand new plane, exit row with hard sides, which made them extremely narrow and uncomfortable. FA's were ok. Terminal 2 at JFK is awful, cramped, with old and few food choices - and the one good one was priced at what seemed like 2-3 times street prices."

My first stop was in Atlanta and we were supposed to land there at 8:30am. I was supposed to arrive at Puerto Rico at 2:12pm but we finished landing at 9:30pm. We were stocked in Huntsville, AL airport about 3.5inside the airplane. First because there was a thunderstorm in Atlanta, and that's totally comprehensible because it was for our safety, but then after 2 hours the airplane got a mechanical problem and when we finally were supposed to fly back to Atlanta, they kept us waiting for an additional 1.5 hours. At first they offered us water and snacks (first 30 minutes wait), but then we were there hungry, uncomfortable, without any Wi-Fi connection, and they did not offer us anything. Not a refund, not a meal, nothing. It was a very unpleasant experience and I understand that bad weather conditions is not Delta's fault, they do not have any control on it and they did everything to keep us safe that day. However, if they knew there was a mechanical problem in the airplane, I would expect at least that they change us to a different airplane or if it is a minor problem but they would keep us waiting for more time, have the consideration to offer us something in return for that wait, it could be a meal because that is a proper way to treat your clients, not keep them there in that condition inside the airplane for such a long time."

Beginning with the boarding process, we boarded slightly late. Then with no notice they started boarding us. I was welcomed on board and made my way to the seat. The seat and private space was smaller than I am used to from flying with AA, but it is also a smaller aircraft. The seat offered a full recline, duvet and pillow. I found the seat fairly comfortable and although there was a massage function, it wasn't very effective. I also found there to be very little space to store anything small in the seat. Additional there was no call button for the crew. I was provided an amenity kit which was a very nice Tumi case. After settling in I was offered a drink. The TV display was smaller than I expected with an adequate range of entertainment. The aircraft was WIFI equipped. After take-off I was offered a hot-towel and had my drink order taken, then served a very nice dinner which I could chose from a menu. I found the cabin crew of a very high standard, they went above and beyond and made sure every request was taken care of quickly. This was probably one of the most professional premium class crew I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Unfortunately for breakfast they had run out of the choice I wanted even though the cabin was only 1/4 full. Nonetheless the crew made sure they did whatever they could. I was particularly impressed that I was offered a selection of teas."

A solid 3 star performance. The flights were on time and clean planes. Edible food, but nothing to write home about. Coffee really bad - but than I think so of 95% of the coffee I get in the US, because I'm used to much stronger. Would use Delta again if price is right."

The customer service, however, is a nightmare. I booked a roundtrip flight, and then had to cancel because of scheduling. I cancelled my entire flight within 30 minutes of booking it. I called Delta to confirm I had cancelled and would receive a full refund. The service agent told me everything was confirmed and I would receive a full refund because it was within 24 hours. 8 days went by and I hadn't received a refund yet. I called Delta on 3 different days and was hung up on, transferred, put on hold, and hung up again on multiple times. The third day, I finally got a hold of a real person and told her my predicament.  She said ""That did not occur. That confirmation number you gave me doesn't exist. You'll have to apply for a refund through the website and then it will be up to the auditor's discretion whether or not you receive a refund."" I said, ""But now it's been 8 days, so the auditor will refuse to refund me. I cancelled it within 24 hours - in fact, within one hour - and received confirmation that I did. Are you seriously telling me that whoever I spoke to 8 days ago was just making stuff up and now I'm just out $1200 for no reason?"" She was condescending and cruel, cutting me off. Her official response was that what I was saying never happened and there was nothing anyone could do. All I could do was apply for a refund and the rest was up to the auditor. If I had been able to reach a live person one of the other days I had called, or if the person I had spoken to that night had actually confirmed my cancellation, I would have $684.70 to pay other bills.  $684.70 is way too much money for me to just lose.

Today we wait, inside the airplane for 3 hours, the delay was because, the Captain said, first for an electronic problem, and second because of the wind they had to pull out luggage for overweight.

Missed connecting flight that was to leave at 7:50 because they would not hold flight by 8 minutes since I had to get plane side checked baggage and transfer. Top it all off there was no more flights out that night and if I wanted to stay in a hotel they offered nothing to accommodate.

On my flight from Greater Rochester into RDU, my flight was delayed due to weather. It took me half an hour to find a Delta rep to help me at La Guardia. Upon finally finding a rep, she was rude and unhelpful. I ended up leaving her presence in tears! I was exhausted, frustrated and stressed and all I wanted was a little assistance finding a place to stay in NYC. She just repeated ""Ain't my problem. I don't control the weather."" Over and over. This was a manager by the way. A TSA agent felt the need to apologize on her behalf! For something also out of my control - I had to eat the hotel charge. I paid more for the 2 hours I slept at the hotel than I did for my entire flight. But per Delta, not their problem. I fly with Delta twice a month. I have one more flight with them (already booked) and then my business goes elsewhere."

The true was only that the seats are more comfortable than regular economy class. Food was the same chicken and pasta, very small portion. Glass of wine and if you are lucky to get staff's attention later you might get another. Entertainment was mostly old movies with a very small monitor. Delta advertising is misleading and it not worth paying additional money for the Comfort class."

Just recently a different representative told me otherwise and said it ended in December. I purchased an expensive flight from ATL to DEN for Jan 29th (that would have been much cheaper through Southwest) so that I could obtain the status. Now Delta won't allow those miles to count towards my status and they wont provide a refund for my booked trip. I will be using all of my 250,000 miles for free trips and will ditch the AMEX Delta card along with Delta Airlines all together."

To begin our day of misfortune, our flight was delayed due to weather purposes, which is understandable, till around 10:15 am. As we were flying out from Charlotte to our connecting flight in Detroit, we realized that we only had, what we thought, was a 38 minute layover to make it to our next flight out of Detroit. However, as we were leaving the terminal, we learned that the connecting flight was not delayed at all and we had approximately 3 minutes to make it to the gate before the flight began its departure. As I ran ahead and sprinted to the gate to try and save my family and I some grief, I was greeted by a Delta representative who proceeded to inform me that I was to late to get on the flight, even though I could physically see our plane sitting in the loading spot, motionless. So, my family, along with around 15 other people who experienced the same I convienemt timing and planning due to Delta, watched the flight we had payed for depart in front of us. To try to salvage this situation, the crowd of left behind passengers began to congregate to the airlines help kiosk, where we virtually on went to be told that we needed to call and contact a Delta representative about changing flights - even though there was a representative standing right in front of us. To make things even better, once we had finally jumped through enough hoops and made it onto our flight from Detroit to Las Vegas (6 hours later), we were surprised to find out that not only did any of our luggage make it to Las Vegas, but they were sent on a flight that departed 3 hours after we were scheduled to land. So, after speaking with a Delta baggage representative who realistically was no help, my family and probably 5-10 other passengers sat in the Las Vegas terminal for upwards to 3-3 1/2 hours before finally receiving our baggage. Not to mention that all of this was at the expense of us passengers, with the Delta representative claiming that ""there was nothing that they could do"".

KLM / Air France partnering with Delta Air Lines is a joke. Delta has no respect on the travel details for international flights. If you fly Delta expect delays too. Coming to Orlando via Boston, our delay was roughly 11 hours! They only gave us biscuits and a drink. Flying back from Orlando to Amsterdam via New York JFK, I was ask to pay for a special luggage for 100$ which was included in my travel details from KLM. The funny thing is, they allow me fly with it coming to Orlando but they charge me leaving Orlando. Delta does not respect original ticket details from its partner airline."

I usually fly first class, however I was flying with my 3 year old daughter and wanted to be able to lift the arm rest so we went premium economy. Supposedly, premium economy provides complimentary beverages. On a 4.5 hr flight I consumed 3 units of white wine and several club sodas. The flight attendant then informed me, and everyone within earshot that she ""did not feel comfortable serving me any more alcohol"". I have never experienced this in first class, or coach. When I called to complain about the lack of promised services and the atrociously rude behavior of the flight attendant, I received incredibly rude service and no compensation for the $50 a piece glasses of wine which is what I ended up paying. While my experiences with Delta have been good in the past, I am appalled at the way I was treated tonight and will not be flying Delta anytime soon. If you are trying to decide between first class and premium economy, realize that Delta treats their premium economy passengers worse than their coach passengers."

Three of the flights were delayed; the airline did send out updates to the smartphone. The worst delay was the last leg where the flight attendant did not show up for work! The pilot at the gate announced that the flight attendant's phone had been turned off and they were not able to reach the person. Finally, a substitute was found and we were able to complete our journey. Another irritating experience with this trip was that after every segment I received a survey questionnaire on my phone from Delta asking about the flight experience. Not the best time to ask - if only they would focus on consistent service and sticking to the schedule! At least our skis were delivered with us."

Much better lounge with some decent food. Definitely worth the travel between terminals, if you have the time. International config B757 to Boston. Seats are okay, with lots of gadgets and somewhat narrow. I like the storage areas, as there are several and once again the IFE, on a very large screen was very good. A decent lunch, but still substandard in comparison to AA. Decent and professional flight attendants. All flights on time. First bag off. Not a bad trip at all.

On our return, we flew into Laguardia and waited to board our last flight to finally get home, when we were told there was a medical emergency on board and the plane would be late. As time went by the reason was quickly changed to bad weather so that the airline would not be responsible for any expenses they would have to pay out to their customers. Most of us were rerouted the next morning at 6:00am first bound for Atlanta, and then returning north to our final destination. I can't tell you how many passengers were left without a place to go, (they told us the terminal would be closed overnight,) and when we asked for food vouchers and water, we were all told that ""Delta no longer provides these things for their customers when flights are cancelled."" Had they not told their usual lies, many of us could have helped ourselves before it was too late. With a whole lot of angry people demanding answers, I would have hated to be the one behind the counter. We all asked to speak to the supervisor - she was of no help whatsoever. Some of us gathered people who lived in the same areas and made the decision to rent cars and trucks to get home as most weren't going to chance being marooned in another airport.

Flight from SYR to JFK was on time and uneventful. The normal 55 minutes or so. Landed minutes before noon at Gate B45 and was delighted to find that my connection to Boston was going out from Gate B44. Delighted until the gate agent at arrival said there would be a delay due to ""no pilot"". From that point onward the departure kept changing later and later. The gate agent, though polite, had no information to offer. Kept repeating ""we're waiting for an incoming flight"". We knew that already. Since I also had an onward connection to Cape Cod at Logan, I was concerned that I might miss the last flight. The delay and lack of any real information was maddening. The gate people, to their credit, brought out snacks, water and soda. Finally had a plane arrive and had a lengthy boarding process with a lot of counting and re-counting passengers. Finally arrived in Boston at 5pm. A very long day and still not home. Why can't an airline simply tell their passengers what's going on?"
2066,3,3,January,2016,Economy Class,JFK , SEA        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,Missoula to Seattle. No seat assignment was able to be obtained at time of booking which was far in advance of our trip date. Flight was overbooked by three seats and seats weren't to be assigned until actual boarding time. They wouldn't begin boarding the flight until three passengers opted out but no departure time for a subsequent flight was ever announced. Our family was not able to sit together. The flight was one hour late arriving in Seattle and many passengers were either too late for their connecting flight or were very rushed to make their connections. No hot beverages were served. In the future we will only fly with Delta as a last resort.

Brilliant service from cabin crew and extras offered - good food on the long haul stint of the trip to Atlanta. For an economy ticket I was very impressed.

My only improvement would be made to the ground staff in London Heathrow who were okay but miserable. "

On the Delta Air Lines Boeing 767 you have seating of 2-3-2 in economy, so it is not bad with a companion. The plane is old, but was refurbished a few years ago so they have good AVOD. The food going and coming was actually good. The FA's were quick and efficient and even smiled. The economy seat gets hard on your lower back after 3 hours. Seat pitch was tolerable. Surprised that it all went well and was uneventful. Gogo in-flight wifi was not available. I do not think that the 767-300ER is a good one for business class. It looked really cramped."

This review covers the flight from Detroit to Shanghai. Flight left three hours late. Not sure why, but had to move a plane from Atlanta. Not one announcement in the lounge of the delay. Crew handled themselves well. Service was spotty but the worst was the food served after we left Detroit. The main course was inedible and I felt badly for the folks who had to serve it. Apparently it was a new menu and lots of complaints. Maybe the economy meal was better. Won't be flying Delta overseas again."

The flight was overbooked and I volunteered to give up my seat and take an electronic voucher. The voucher was good for one year. Due to personal issues, I was not able to use the voucher and wanted to book a flight for my son. The customer service rep tried to help me, but he needed permission from his supervisor to override the rule and book the flight for my son. The Supervisor denied my request. I waited on the phone for 44 minutes  to be told the voucher will be useless. I certainly would not have wasted my time in an airport if I had known all of the rules attached to the voucher. I was doing Delta a favor by volunteering and obviously they are able to override this rule, or the customer service rep would not have tried. I am very dissapointed in an airline that was always my first choice when traveling for work. Delta will no longer be my choice of airlines."

Ok, try connecting to the gogo service, which is 'powered by oracle' and for those of you more in the know Oracle is not exactly a 'streaming video' company. Ok, try to connect to the video service Nothing works, for anyone around as well. IPad, windows android devices all have the same issue.

Instead of letting us get on the delayed flight and letting the Atlanta staff deal with the connections which were all overbooked, the check-in counter staff put us at a hotel for the night and got us on a direct flight the following the morning.

I originally booked through ATL but weather there resulted in huge delays so we were rushed on a flight to DTW. This also ruined our plan to meet up with friends on the connecting flight from ATL to AMS. they were flying in from MIA. In Detroit I received message they were rerouted through JFK to be flying on KLM. I checked my aps and saw that flight to be wide open as well as a connecting flight from DTW to JFK. So in the main lounge of Delta I asked a ticketing agent if they could reroute us through JFK. I knew that since we were already involuntary rerouters, our ticket status would allow that. The agent said he could, then asked a supervisor who only saw trouble and problems, then said: sorry no seats on the flight to JFK. I just like to make a point that ticketing agents should not lie to  customers. Delta's systems are so transparent that such lies wont hold. I did not persist but when I left the lounge for my flight to Amsterdam the JFK flight was boarding and the flatscreen said it had 20 open seats and that only 89 out of 117 had checked in which meant 48 open seats.  On the flight to Amsterdam I was in row 6 - food orders were taking from the back and when it was my turn, I was only offered one out 3 food choices, the rest had finished. The food was terrible. When i mentioned it to a FA, I was told to contact Delta.com. Everything about the service was rushed and done in such a way it was convenient for the FA's : we took off at 4:15 pm. we were ordered to close blinds, then the lights were shut off. Dinner was rushed. Message: get to sleep. However when it was time for breakfast: no mercy: full lights on."

My husband suggested that he was in the wrong seat. The man immediately became verbally abusive to my husband and; I and I was scared because we were traveling with my daughter and a pet. The stewardesses instead of coming to our aid, we complaining that we were holding up people boarding. One flight attendant from the back of the plane came to our aid and said I should accompany her to the back of the plane while the situation was resolved. Meanwhile the man continued to harass my husband and daughter. Once people were seated, a flight attendant came to the area and tried to get the man to show his boarding pass. He continued to refuse this request. Eventually he showed his boarding pass but refused to move. I was told I would have to sit across the aisle. He continue to harass my husband during the flight. He threw trash in the aisle in my direction. He made cell phone calls during the flight. Nothing was done or said to him. He placed empty drink cups in the aisle saying he hoped the attendants tripped on them. At the end of the flight, he refused to stand up to let my husband & daughter out of their seats. We complained at the airport but were left as unimportant and not necessary to deal with. Nothing was done to ensure our connecting flight would be more pleasant. I will never reserve again with Delta. On our way to a different terminal I was instructed by a Delta pilot to put my pet back in her carrier. I was trying to give her some water. I did as he requested, but he continued to get in my face to tell me he was ""doing me a favor"" and I should be appreciative.

When I finally found the hidden local number, the curt person at the other end informed me that they would do nothing for me: no hotel voucher or reimbursement, no upgrade, no free drink, no mile, no polite apology.

They claim due to bad weather in other cities that have put their pilots over their time limit. Does Delta management have any clue in how to account for bad weather?

2081,1,25,December,2015,Premium Economy,SFO , BUF , DTW      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Mechanical issues out of BHM on A320, but we were updated every few mins by cabin crew-which eased the tension as I only had a 42 minute connection in ATL. Just about made the connection. Overall not bad on the eastbound legs. Food outstanding out of ATL. Good service, a little stand off-ish, but generally good. Arrived LHR 40 mins early. No Line at fast track and bags already on carousel so overall a good experience. LHR-BHM wasn't quite so smooth. Food terrible & this is not an understatement. I had baked cod that was described as crispy, but in fact was chewy and slightly rancid, so I didn't eat it. As I usually find eating in a plane more of a diversion than anything else I was happy to pass on the food. My son chose basil tortellini but bizarrely came in a cream green curry sauce. Not sure what the were thinking when they came up with this menu. Not nearly as good as Eastboud USA origination. My wife had the oxtail that she said was really nice, so I guess my son and I just made poor choices. Service (apart from 1 FA) could only be described as frosty. Landed ATL 20 mins early. Security a breeze. Now the fun begins. I picked up a text from DL to inform me connection was delayed by 45 mins, no big deal here, but as it was last flight out on Xmas eve and seeing the lines for rebooking I was starting to get a bad feeling. Then the flight delayed another hour. The heart starts to pound a little more, then 15 mins before boarding and it gets cancelled. Was then given 2 options 9.55pm on Xmas day or 6.10, but couldn't accommodate all 3 of us so we would have to choose who was in which flight. Really! Delta sucks when it comes to these type of occurrences. Yes, the delay was weather related and was mostly out of their control, but to have no reasonable back up plan is poor. They had already cancelled one of the earlier ATL-BHM flights, so surely could have anticipated this a little better. In the end I managed to get a car from Avis and drive myself, so all was not lost. If I had taken Delta's option I'd no doubt be feeling a little like Tom Hanks in the 'traveller'! To be fair to Delta they did offer a hotel for the night. I think I'm more frustrated that it was Xmas, than anything else."

We had upgraded to Delta comfort on our flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam, a long international flight. The biggest reason for this is there were only 2 seats in the row which was perfect for my fiancÃ© and I. However, upon checking in - we find our row now has 3 seats - and I'm at the window. And she is in the aisle. With someone in between us. We called Delta and they apologized, but could do nothing about it. It's our first big international trip and either we are apart from each other the whole flight or someone is getting stuck in the middle. Neither of which is very appealing. We normally only fly American. I guess we should have stuck with what we know instead of taking a chance on Delta."

They were too cowardly to announce that our flight was canceled overhead and just ignored the passengers till we figured it out. This all happened on Christmas eve! Hundreds of Delta passengers were stranded in an airport on Xmas eve and they gave us no answers and no apologies or vouchers were offered. The staff was incredibly callous and unsympathetic. They had 1 customer service rep to help over a hundred people in line. The situation was handled so badly. I've never been treated so poorly by an airline. I will never fly Delta again.

At the end, they ended up de-planing us, made us walk back through customs and immigration, and then had a large line-up to re-book flights. When they booked us on a flight, they ended up delaying that flight without telling us, and then they tried to put us on another airline very last minute, made us walk all the way to the other end of the airport where the counter told us that flight had already left. So we had to come all the way back and they are trying to rebook us from scratch. Wasted an entire day at the airport and there are still no definitive answers. The service was friendly though."

When the steward came round to give us peanuts and biscuits I asked him if he could turn the aircon down - he told me to cover my legs with a blanket - as I'd already done this and was still cold I asked if he could turn the aircon down as I'm cold. He said I don't agree with you, it's a good temperature and if I turn it down the other passengers will be too warm. He was so dismissive of my request and abrupt that I was embarrassed by his attitude. My flight home was an unpleasant experience as he was passing me for the whole flight (I fell asleep and missed breakfast so had to ask him for one, he went and got me one then threw it on my table) to be treated like that on what should be a pleasant experience was unacceptable. The three people in front off us was also cold trying to get warm all the time, one of them wearing a hat and the others huddling under blankets to keep warm."

The domestic first class seats were comfortable enough, and there was a charging port between the seats as well, however there was no inflight entertainment. We were offered snacks like peanuts, potato chips, and crackers out of a basket, and all drinks were free. However, because of the short length of the flight there was no meal service, and even some of the larger snacks like tapas were unavailable. The flight attendants were polite and nice, but they were not above and beyond, and didn't interact with the passengers more than they had to. As we were flying in the Delta One cabin international, we got free access to the Sky Club, however with so many people flying for the holidays, it was overly crowded, and a restaurant by our boarding gate was a much better option to spend our two hour layover. When the flight from Atlanta to Brussels finally boarded, we were promptly offered champagne or orange juice. There was a Westin pillow and comforter set, TUMI amenities kit with a pen, lip balm and lotion, eye mask, socks, tissues, mouthwash, and earplugs. After passengers were seated, attendants brought cashews and refilled our champagne. About an hour after take off dinner service included option of beef or cod. The inflight entertainment was rather limited with about 30 or so movies and a handful of television shows on seatback screens. The staff was friendly, but didn't quite go out of their way to do anything. When we arrived in Brussels, after a quick mix up at passport control, we were on our way after an enjoyable flight in relative comfort."

We should have know from the start of this flight with the mayhem at the airport that this was not going to be good. We finally boarded and then had to wait on the tarmac for an hour due to heavy air traffic. The Captain kept us up to date, but still we were an hour late. There was one FA in Business and three in Economy. They announced that the beverage service would begin shortly and that passengers in Business and Delta Comfort were entitled to complimentary drinks, which was one of the reasons I booked DC in addition to the additional legroom. The beverage service started and we were in the second row of the Comfort seats. Everyone around me ordered soda, coffee, water but no one order an alcoholic drink even though it was late afternoon. When the surly flight attendant got to me I asked for a double gin and tonic. Without smiling she asked if I wanted the whole can. I figured it would save her time so I said yes. She couldn't find tonic in her drawer, harrumphed and walked back to get one. Upon returning she asked if I wanted one cup or two. I told her one would be fine. As she opened the first of the two gin bottles she looked at me and said, ""I'll give you these two but that's all you're going to get."" (She wasn't kidding.) I was dumbfounded. I didn't have any intention of ordering more, but I didn't need her to ensure I knew I wouldn't be getting any more - regardless of the fact that I was in a seat entitled to ""complimentary drinks"" (no mention of a limit). She pushed her cart to the next row and moved on. Later in the flight I wanted some water and got up and went to the rear galley, where the three FA's were enjoying one of the cheese and cracker snack boxes. They were talking and I didn't want to interrupt, but waited until one of them noticed me standing in the doorway. After several minutes one of them did and asked, ""What can I get you?"" ""A bottle of water please."" Her terse reply, ""We don't have bottled water,"" to which I replied, ""Fine then. A cup of water please."" She turned around, tossed the cup on top of the bin of ice on the cart, sloshed some water in the cup and handed it to me, never asking if I wanted ice (the water was room temp). I returned to my seat, looked at my husband and said Delta sucks. I understand if FA's are miserable when dealing with nasty passengers, but when the passenger is being polite there is no need to be surly and curt. Just one more example of how much US airlines have to learn."

Customer service in Dayton was ok but Atlanta, as usual, was awful. Delta apparently does not allow you to purchase tickets and to pick a seat at that time .

After waiting in line for an hour, another agent went on break, leaving one agent. When she was finished with her customer, a sky priority customer jumped ahead to her station, and she helped him, even though there were four sky priority agents working. Then another customer, from nowhere cut the entire line, and she let her do this. No back up - yet only one agent. Finally, 2 agents came back from break, and lucky us our agent could only get us on a flight 10 hours later, we were offered no comps, and no upgrades. I was crying when I told our agent that I would be charged an extra 100 dollars by our rental car company, which I don't have the money for, and he just said sorry. Not to mention the increased rate we paid for a non-red eye (I don't sleep on flights.) On the red eyes we were given seats that do not recline , making it impossible to get some shut eye.

During a long haul flight the queues for the toilet were constant and a disturbance, also being the last seats on the plane our choice of food was non existent as we had to have what was left. I contacted customer service at Delta from New York as I did not want the return flight to be as bad. I was informed that I should or could have chosen my seats when I booked online to begin with and this was on the website, which I have to confess I had not seen or noticed (but I will look out for it next time I book). I explained I was not happy and was offered seats further down the plane at a cost of $40.00 each (total of $160.00), I told the lady in customer services that I was unhappy that I had to pay an extra $160.00 for something I could have had for free and she very kindly spoke to her supervisor and waived the costs which was very good of Delta. I really want to point out to people as I had not noticed it that you can request seats as when booking to begin with which is quite obviously what most people are doing."

They didn't say a word about a different policy because it was late check in. We should have just thrown out the jelly, but that would be expecting us to know their policies. I do not know whether the person who took the report was lying to me or simply incompetent. The seats were horribly uncomfortable on both parts of the trip. They want you to put carry-on items under the seats, but the seats are so close that it is very difficult to get them out again. The aisles are so narrow that even really skinny people hit other travelers when they walk down the aisles. The final part of our trip was delayed because the previous flight was late getting there. One of the flight crew kept trying to speed up the boarding process. He yelled at people not to block the aisles, and to let others around them. That seems like fine advice, but it seems he didn't notice that a lot of the people didn't speak English. Instructions spoken in English, no matter how loud, are not helpful when the person doesn't speak English."
2099,1,17,December,2015,Economy Class,New York , London       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Downgraded from paid first class. I booked a paid first class seat for myself and then a day before my trip my son decided he wanted to come with me, so I paid for him to travel along side. I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin. As it was a short flight I ended up downgrading myself also as my son is only 8. Eventually I got a decent credit with Delta, but was pretty mad about their process as it simply makes no sense to downgrade a paid customer and enforce a 2nd paid customer to also downgrade themselves."

The customer service and information technology could use a complete overhaul. The flight was two hours delayed for two separate reasons. Firstly, the airline allowed a passenger that was not on the flight onto the flight and did not notice until we were about to take off. Secondly, in this process the plane ran out of gas. The crew were very poor at addressing these problems and the passengers were left in the dark through out most of this delay. I will never fly this airline again."

Flight to ATL on a newer B737-900 with Sky Interior. Nice Seats, a little less legroom, as Delta's domestic FC only has 37"" of pitch. Seat pretty comfortable, inflight entertainment is really good, on demand. No food service as this flight is 86 miles short of qualifying for breakfast, just drinks. Flight attendants were fine, yet hardly seen as once again, no real service. Hiked it to Terminal F to experience the Delta Sky Club there. This is a much better club, with some pretty good food offerings. ATL-BOS leg on a Intl configured B757, seat looks nice, is somewhat narrow, seat does not offer a full leg rest unless you recline into the full bed position., so a decent seat with a short leg rest, in the seated position. Lunch was a Turkey Pastrami sandwich, with bagged chips and a store bought wrapped cookie. Come on Delta, this is First Class, which, I pay for, as always, not an FF upgrade, prepackaged food for lunch. The food service is where Delta fails in comparison to American, my other preferred carrier. Delta's food tastes fine, yet presentation is totally lacking. Iâ€™m Elite with Delta, American and Virgin America, Deltaâ€™s gate employees tend to be very nice, but on board offering are not up to par."

It was extremely hot (coming from a person who is cold most of the time) when we boarded the aircraft and remained that way the entire flight, which made it uncomfortable. We were offered a beverage and snack not very long after we departed with the next beverage offering not until 45 minutes before we landed. Between the hot temperature and not being offered enough water, or some type of beverage, I was dehydrated. The experience was enough for me to not want to fly on Delta ever again."

I booked my flight through Westjet so Delta is refusing to do anything about it despite the lady at the help desk saying they would. Agent gave me boarding pass to different flight without telling me mine had been cancelled. This flight was delayed and we were not communicated with whatsoever causing many of us to miss our connections. Staff were stressed and rude. Told us we could try running. Connection left 3 minutes before departure even though there were five of us running to get there. New flight landed at midnight meaning either sleep in the airport or try to get picked up then which was not possible for many of us. Refused to get us hotel since we couldn't get picked up. Told us to complain and we would receive some kind of compensation which is now not happening either. Absolutely nothing was done to help us out during the experience. We were never communicated with and had to ask repeatedly to find out what was going on. I was promised they'd fix it and they refuse to do anything to make up for it.

The seats in the first class cabin are spaced so close that the tray tables cannot be put in place if the passenger in front of you has reclined his/her seat. This was true of any first class passenger faced with the situation. The flight attendant offered lamely that she wondered why this was a problem saying: ""That's strange."" Well, it's not strange, Delta has crowded more seats into first class than the seats are designed to permit. It was VERY difficult to get seated in so little foot room as there was. I would only subscribe to Delta first class for routing purposes and would not recommend its first class to anyone."

Smooth checkin at T3 - I could not checkin on line, as if you are not an US Citizen or travel with Visa Waiver, but have a visa, you cannot checkin online - ridiculous. Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse was amazing and a pleasure to use.  Boeing 767-400 has 1-2-1 configuration in Business Class, but seat is quite hard and very narrow, especially when reclined - it is hard to move when you sleep. Cabin crew was quite young and very friendly. Boiling hot hot towels (some passengers drop them on the floor, as it was hard to hold it). Surprisingly good food, average wine list (I'd expect more American wines), but Delta Sunrise Signature Cocktail was a hit. Excellent dessert cart. Very disappointing IFE - no blockbuster hits, just a few new movies, TV shows I've never heard of - simply, there was nothing to watch. Because of some turbulence there was no second service. Arrived on time. Generally, decent product, better than expected, very nice crew, but nothing special to remember except signature cocktail which was a hit."

Needs the home address, account gets locked for 24 hours, cannot add miles with confirmation number [need ticket number], associates contacted by email do not read the emails and/or do not have access to the correct systems to help. Entirely too much work for like $27 worth of miles (4000 of a 60000(?) free ticket worth $400 or so). Ridiculously inefficient and terrible system with no value."

Gate agents were nice and got us onboard quickly, all flights were on time. Didn't purchase food on the plane, but drinks and snacks were given. Entertainment was only on longer flights but was good. My one complaint is that the TVs didn't have ABC which caused me to miss the Michigan-Ohio State game. I think thats an issue with ABC, because United and Jet Blue which use Directv also don't have ABC. (Delta uses Dish Network.) Staff were friendly throughout and seats were ok comfort wise."

Unlike AA, I have zero ""privileges"" / status on DL, but even with that the flights were far better than what I have become accustomed to. Boarding on the two outbound and the two return segments went smoothly. Ground staff, and cabin staff were friendly, smiling, and even uttered words like ""please"" and ""thank you,"" which the AA employees forgot sometime back in the 1990s. Their uniforms were neat, clean and pressed. The boarding process, even in ""Zone 2,"" was organized and efficient, again in contrast to the priority boarding / rugby scrum I usually encounter at AA gates in Miami. DL pulls off boarding, somehow, with only one agent, which probably cuts labor costs and frees up more money for amenities like charging stations all over their Atlanta terminals. IS DL up to European or Asian standards? Probably not. But for the money, and a domestic US trip, this was a good value. I'll consider switching again in the future. A pleasant surprise!"

Today however is different. I've been pushed to the limit and will make a note, of the terrible service that I've received on Delta. I'm on flight AF9301 seat 41H from Minneapolis to Paris CDG. Flight attendant takes the poor Delta service to a new low. First, she is ramming her food cart onto seats and passengers shoulders and proceeds with no remorse or even a simple excuse me. Just passed with a drinks cart, looks like she looks at faces, and chooses who she will ask if they need a drink or not. She clearly ignored me as I awaited to get a drink, and I must say, I have never felt disrespected this much. I had to politely ask another attendant if drinks were for purchase or complementary, just to calm my head. Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman. When I asked why the attendants seemed so disrespectful, a senior attendant mentioned something along the lines of staffing etc, which I personally, thought was an excuse, as the aircraft seemed to be less than half full.  If had a choice, I would never fly Delta again. Unfortunately Delta is too big an airline, that my choices are narrowed and I keep finding myself on Delta flights."

Every step of the way Delta employees went out of their way to make the trip as easy as possible. They were efficient and friendly, and made what could have been a painful trip totally smooth. Wheelchairs were waiting at every point; the flight attendants were caring and attentive, and our luggage was checked as a courtesy and was waiting for us when we arrived at baggage claim.

It appears this toilet is for business class only and my girlfriend was not only challenged by a horrible air steward but a middle aged passenger who took it upon himself to block the aisle and become obnoxious to her - I made my feelings pretty clear to him as you can imagine. In general the staff were unhelpful and just not interested, the complete opposite from the Virgin crew we had on the outward journey. The food was not good plus the inflight entertainment system was not working properly. I would not travel with Delta again if my life depended in it."

It was a full flight with many passengers having already flown for some 8 hours already internationally to Amsterdam. The baggage and food was loaded onto the flight, the KLM representatives were at the gate to board everyone, and then we were told the crew simply did not show up to fly the plane. Later the flight was cancelled - without any announcement or posting on the electronic boards, and hundreds of passengers had to stand about 7 hours in line to get rebooked!! People were exhausted. Many had other horror stories about past experiences with Delta that some said cancelled flights for no reason at all or because they can. Unprofessional and unreliable. Avoid if you can. Too bad KLM is partnering with Delta now."

On our first attempt our plane had to be taxi back due to a malfunction in the cockpit. We completely understand about malfunctions and the crew was able to get everyone on the flight on another plane within an hour. My biggest complaint was the fact that once we boarded our second plane we had to wait an additional hour bc we were waiting for the catering cart to arrive. My recommendation would be to wait until the plane is ready to go before boarding passengers. There was a few passengers that we're getting impatient and one passenger even had an outburst saying ""who cares about the food, let's just go. Let's Go!"" Our seats were bad this time but no fault to Delta we just had kids behind us both flights and the first flight a kid pulled my wife's hair and on the second flight a kid and their parents kept bumping our seats. Normally we have very good experiences with Delta airlines and I would recommend them over some other airlines. Just having the stress of this being Thanksgiving weekend our experience was not enjoyable as it has been in the past."

Iâ€™M Silver with Delta, Platinum with AA and Gold with Virgin. Delta ranks third for their First Class offering. Seat pitch is the tightest at 37â€, the food options on flights under 900 miles is a snack basket. As a Sky Club member, in addition to Admirals Club membership, we used both. I feel Deltaâ€™s Clubs are minimalistic in comparison. The bars are small and the food offering are somewhat amateurish. Donâ€™t get me wrong. Boarding was orderly and we did not have to wait due to Priority. The planes were clean, the seat cushion is comfortable. All our flights left on time and arrived on time. Breakfast served to SLC, a plate with a Bagel Breakfast Sandwich on it, a side dish with some fruit. The Quality and taste were fine, the meal just looked un substantial compared to my other proffered carriers. The flight attendant to SLC was pleasant, did his job quickly and sat and read for the remainder of the flight. The Flight to SAN had a very proactive flight crew, constantly in the aisle, refilling drinks and constantly passing the snack basket, with some decent offerings. The return flight to SLC offered again the snack basket and some wine. A somewhat cold, but very professional attendant served us on this leg. She performed her job very well. The last flight to Austin offered dinner. After my earlier in the week breakfast flight, I was not expecting much. I was surprised to be offered a perfectly cooked Fillet, with sides and a dinner roll. Desert sadly was a pre packed brownie (Really, Prepackaged in First). All in all Delta did its job, we were spot on time and our bags came out fairly quickly. The food offering are spares in compared to other, but what was offered was of decent quality. We fly a lot, hence the Elite status with (3) carriers. Delta, while still good, ii is still my 3rd choice. The inflight GoGo Entertainment failed completely on all four legs. We were glad we did not have to pay for it."

In the the past with every Delta flight they have lost my luggage, delayed me hours, and made me pay for another ticket for getting stuck in a snow storm.

However, our flight from ATL to EWR was delayed due to weather. Fine. Then we had to wait for the flight attendants to arrive before we could even board. So instead of boarding at 9:41pm we had to wait even longer before we could even board. It is ridiculous that we were unaware of when we would arrive to our destination. Many people had children and it's insane that we will be arriving past midnight. The most unorganized flight I've been on. I won't be going to Delta anytime soon."
2120,2,19,November,2015,Economy Class,SLC , ATL        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"We have flown Delta on numerous occasions as we have a house and business in US. Our honest opinion is that in general we use Delta because we prefer to fly from our local airport, and this is a service supplied in conjunction with Air France and KLM via Paris / Amsterdam. Overall, the service is poor. We have found cabin staff mostly friendly and helpful, though not always. Food is usually ok but I am afraid that on numerous flights pre booked months in advance, my family are seated in different parts of the plane, most unacceptable particularly dissappointing when you have booked a family holiday months in advance. When challenging them about this we get nowhere. The last flight we checked in online and received a telephone call to say all was ok but when we were checking our luggage in on the return journey we were told at check in 'oh this flight goes tomorrow evening'! Now after much arguing and apologies we were put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt but 35 hours door to door from US to UK is totally unacceptable. This experience on numerous occasions has made us reconsider. The flight experience is far too much hassle for a family and I have to say I am relieved we do not have to endure this ever again. I have complained to the airline on a number of occasions but as yet I have received no response. In my opinion Delta are a letdown to the whole ethos of customer service and care in the US and I will certainly not contemplate using their services again."

I've found it very relaxing and comfortable because they do have a reclining chair which where you could take a nap (but just be mindful of your boarding time). Boarding was smooth, and onboard the flight attendants are very nice, especially the Japanese crews. The only regret on my experience is that the IFE is poor - they have limited movies to watch. Also, the blankets aren't really comfortable. But the meals are okay, and waiting for the baggage was quick on arrival."

Once he took our bags, he produced both of our boarding passes printed out. Since my phone died shortly after that, it really came in handy!

On return, while we had to wait about 20 minutes to take off (for whatever reason), we still landed early. The only downside on the outbound flight was that the flight was so quick that beverage service couldn't be completed. Both flights were completely filled. However, by getting to the airport early for the return flight, I was able to get moved from a center seat to a window seat further up in coach class.

We called and asked if they could put us together so we could help each other keep the kids calm, since we had bought tickets with four seats right next to each other. They were very rude and basically said deal with it.

Due to this, I was unable to make it to work Wednesday night and accumulated another days' expenses from on site parking, Delta only felt the need to give me a limited $50 gift card."

We have flown Delta before with no problems, and have rated them highly. However this time the flight from MCO was cancelled whilst we were waiting to board (""aircraft is broke""), and we were informed replacement was being sent from ATL, which wouldn't land at MCO until after LHR flight had departed. Mad panic with a full Boeing 757 passenger list trying to contact Delta customer services using the 6 available telephones. Eventually got through, and was offered flight from ATL to Paris, with a connection to LHR. Had to point out to the operator this would take-off whilst we were en-route to ATL. Eventually got offered flight to Philadelphia, to connect to a London flight the next evening. Asked if there was a way to contact England to advise our taxi company not to pick us up until following day. They said they had no international calling arrangements. Got to ATL about 10:45 at night, then spent about an hour trying to arrange overnight hotel (three quarter full flight, and 4 customer service clerks). Eventually given voucher for hotel, and told to wait at the hotel shuttle pick up point outside. Hotel shuttle didn't turn up, and wasn't listed on list of hotel contacts to allow us to contact it. Eventually driver from another hotel took pity on the 14 of us booked to that hotel, and took us there. The hotel also had no way of making international calls. Next morning we found voucher was for accommodation only - we had to pay for breakfast! Flight to Philly was ok-ish (a MD88 is not as good as a 757). London-bound plane was a half-empty 757. However, although Premium Economy was almost empty we were still only allowed in Economy unless we were willing to pay for upgrade. The only time previously we have had a rearranged flight, also because of broken aircraft, was with BA who automatically upgraded us. Was also surprised that , if we wanted to watch any of the films on offer, we would have to pay by credit card. Never had this before on a transatlantic flight - even Delta ones. However cannot fault the onboard flight crew or service. The seats, however were uncomfortable, and 9 hours is a long time to sit in an uncomfortable seat. When we got back to LHR, no checked baggage. They were delivered to our home later that day on 2 separate deliveries, because one had arrived on a later Delta flight from JFK, the other had arrived on an earlier Virgin flight, also from JFK! So, in addition to us having an extra wasted day, Delta have caused us to be out of pocket for meals we wouldn't have had to pay for, and a taxi that went to LHR to meet us. The in-flight experience is ok. It is the customer service side that needs attention. I would still use them, but never use them for a connecting service again."

All arrived ahead of schedule, so twice we had to wait about 15 minutes for a gate to become available. We traveled with just carry-on and were able to take our bags on-board even on full flights. We especially appreciated the overhead compartment valet service in Atlanta, our only experience. The Atlanta flight crew was also the most upbeat and friendly, but being fellow Southerners, perhaps that was the most familiar. Beverage service was often on our long flights. The only negative was a bit of crowding with an oversized passenger on a three seat row, but that couldn't be helped."

Seriously, Delta - get with it. We pay these extremely high prices and Delta Air Lines are still putting regional planes on international routes. Shame. Service, food and staff was all fine. This seat was the 1x2x1 configuration. I was in Seat 5A. I am 6'4"" and I can't fit when the bed is flat. I find the enclosed foot area very bothersome. The bathrooms are shared with economy class. It was small, and midway through the flight was filthy. I'd say if you were flying this route, make sure to stay away from the Boeing 767-400 equipment."
2132,1,6,November,2015,Economy Class,LHR , SEA        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Australia,Not Specified,Delta Air Lines from Los Angeles to New York JFK. Check in efficient. Bought a day pass and used the DL Skyteam Lounge at LAX Terminal 5. Simple but good selection of food. Drinks had to be paid for. Wifi good. Able to use clean showers. Boarding on time. Flight operated by Boeing 767-300ER with updated interior. Left on time. Friendly Cockpit crew and cabin crew good. Since red eye flight slept most of the way. Crew did 2 services during flight offering beverages for anyone awake. Good IFE. Arrived early. No issues at all. Again super flight.
2133,4,6,November,2015,Premium Economy,SFO , YYC , LAX      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Never flying Delta again. My initial arrival time was supposed to be 9.54 pm, then plane had to turn around because of a mechanical problem. We got put on another flight around 11.15 pm, we made it to the runway, only to have to turn around and go back because the captain of the planes shift was almost over. Now having to wait until 2.30 am to catch another flight. This is ridiculous."
2134,10,6,November,2015,Economy Class,LHR , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"SLC to ATL, Airbus 320. All staff were very friendly and professional. Boarding was orderly. The snacks offered in EC were very good. The food for sale was surprisingly good. My wife and I selected items that were in a brown paper bag and included 2 roast beef sandwiches, a bag of chips and cookies. My only complaint was that there was no IFE system. This could be that the flight was only 3 hours. Basically, I do not see much difference between first class and EC on Delta. I would say that I see more smiling faces from employees on Delta than on their competitors."
2135,4,5,November,2015,Economy Class,LAX , CVG , DFW      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"We booked on a Delta Air Lines buddy pass a few weeks before for a round trip. After arriving in Phoenix from Detroit we found out on the way home that the payment had been cancelled, and even though we were still listed online for the standby list, they refused to let us on. The airline attendants could not and would not explain how the pass was cancelled, why the payment was canceled, we tried logging in ourselves to rescheduled and the system wouldn't let us. The attendants were useless and we ended up borrowing a buddy pass from a complete stranger who felt bad for us. The airline system was unorganized, showing different information for us online and the airline attendants; the attendants knew nothing and did nothing to correct the situation, I was basically told to call customer service to reschedule my flight. They had even sent us a confirmation email that morning. What a joke! Totally not worth the cost when other airlines have pretty much the same rate with cheaper bag charges. I'm giving this airline a 1/10 because none of these other features matter if they can't even accurately communicate the status of your flight reservation."
2136,1,5,November,2015,Business Class,SEA , ANC        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"I made a mistake booking to New York Friday with my family. Instead of 09.40am, I put it as pm on my phone when I booked it. I just caught and called Delta, they said it would be $700 change fee per person x 4 -the flight only cost me $1500 roundtrip for all four. Nice customer service, honest mistake and my whole family gets screwed over on a family vacation. I am a frequent flyer with Delta because of the hub in Detroit. I will do whatever I can not to fly them again."
2137,4,5,November,2015,Premium Economy,LAX , LAS        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Australia,Not Specified,"New York JFK to Saint Martin return with Delta Air Lines. Check in good. Boarding process well managed. Prompt offer of beverage by engaging crew. Flights left on time and arrived 30 minutes before schedule. Both planes had personal IFE. Return Boeing 757-200 was a newer plane with new Boeing interior and comfy seats. Outbound flight meals were nice, return was so so. Efficient crew and who enjoyed their job. Pleasant and good experience."
2138,7,3,November,2015,Business Class,Las Vegas , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Take off on time. Good leg space - paid Â£64 per seat to upgrade to Delta+ which is the premium economy section. The one negative is that if you are not a regular flyer with the carrier, online check in is a pain as the seat options are terrible and you have to pay extra to sit together. However, once on board, was impressed with the service and the timeliness. Aircraft looked better than any BA aircraft I have flown on recently. Very friendly FAs. Very bumpy flight across the pond but the crew kept serving water and juice through the flight. Lunch was good. Entertainment options are limited. I would not hesitate flying them again."
2139,1,3,November,2015,Economy Class,LAX , CMH        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"San Francisco to New York with Delta Air Lines, and very impressed all the way around. On the ground the Delta club was quite comfortable with a vast array of breakfast items: juice, good selection of fruits, bread, pastries, hot and cold cereals, espresso machine. The new Delta One seat is very good (obviously made by the same supplier for the SWISS business class long haul seats). It is lie flat and seats have direct aisle access. Service on board attentive and friendly. Food a notch above. The usual fruit selection and omelet, but Delta added a smoke salmon plate. Flight on time. IFE decent. On the whole I liked the product."
2140,1,2,November,2015,Economy Class,YUL , SDQ , JFK      ,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"New York to London with Delta Air Lines. We started off with a very helpful member of staff who checked us in at the screens before we queued to drop our bags off. It all went downhill from there! A misery behind the desk couldn't engage in conversation or even make eye contact before telling us that our seats would be allocated at the desk. She also told us that as we had the same reservation, the seats would be together. Good news as we are newly weds. After waiting at the gate, 15 minutes before scheduled boarding, we had to change to another gate. Pilot/co-pilot announces to the passengers that there was an issue with a fuel pump with the previous plane. (Is that courteous or unnecessary)? Unnessecary for the less confident passengers waiting among us. Over an hour late boarding and we are told that our seats aren't together after all!! The joke of the matter is that when we board, I was sat in the centre of a married couple in an aisle of three seats! That is just total incompetence! Obviously I changed seats with them! Food was barely edible, the orange juice with breakfast was still frozen! Seat pocket was torn, the cabin was shabby and tired. Delayed by +2 hours. It's like this airline has just been thrown together on the cheap and the service and comfort and colour scheme (navy blue, red and bright pink?!) reflects this."
2141,1,30,October,2015,Economy Class,CDG , SMF , SEA      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"It started off as a short delay because the captain didn't show up, the cabin crew were very nice and interacted with the passengers whilst the delay was on. Once we got going, the crew was amazing, young, etc. The uniforms and cabin were very up to date and nice. We arrived only 5 minutes later than our initial arrival time. The cookies and complementary beverages were great."
2142,3,29,October,2015,Economy Class,Boston , Indianapolis        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Extremely disappointed with the flight attendants on this Delta Air Lines flight. Never in my life have I seen such laziness or disrespect. I recently had major spine surgery and have lifting restrictions so I asked for help with putting my bag in the overhead compartment. The flight attendant gave me a dirty look, told me no, said that ""people like you"" shouldn't be allowed to have a carryon if I couldn't lift it, and went back to her conversation with her co-worker!  I'm disabled, not stupid. I've never been treated so badly in my life. Overall, terrible experience."

2144,10,28,October,2015,Premium Economy,Richmond , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I was very disappointed with my Delta Air Lines flight from Honolulu to Salt Lake City. The male flight attendant that serviced my area in First Class was rude and impatient conversing with me. I couldn't hear him as he was asking me a question about what I wanted to eat. He had to ask me three times due to my hard-of-hearing. He rolled his eyes, then strred at me for my answer as he asked, â€œdo you want meal?â€ The person next to me overhead light did not work. My light switch worked her light. The male flight attendant kept telling the lady next to me how to touch the screen because, ""it's sensitive, just like me"". This is all done without a smile. How Rude!.And no can tell me that's Hawaii humor.  Never during the flight did a flight attendant smile or have any gestures of kindness. One third of the way into the flight, my video screen didn't work. The flight tracker didn't work. I couldn't watch my video. When I told a female flight attendant she just said that she would, ""be sure to tell them to write it up"". No apology! So, I just stared at other peoples monitors without sound because I couldn't even read cause my light didn't work and my switch controlled the person sitting next to me! In defense of Delta. I had four other stops (back and forth) and they were all ok to good service."

Absolutely no doubt both my wife and I will do all our travels to China with Delta from now on, but they will get our recommendation at every opportunity."

Pleasantly surprised to see that the Honolulu Seattle leg of this trip only cost about Â£200 or so than the round trip flights from London to Seattle even though it is a five hour journey - perhaps because it is an internal USA flight and not international. Anyway, the first leg when off without a hitch, seat comfortable, food fine entertainment good. The trip from Hawaii to Seattle was overnight, a little less comfortable (it was an economy seat) than the trans Atlantic and packed as an early flight had been cancelled some months earlier. Myself and others offered to have our hand held put in the hold and this worked fine as these bags were the first ones off in Seattle. Third leg was going fine 'til we started take off down the runway. Whereupon the plane slowed and returned to the gate. Apparently a generator had failed so we de-planed and waited 3 hours for a replacement. We were kept informed all the time and given snacks and beverages. Just as about a 100 pizza boxes arrived they announced we could re board and off we went. Unfortunate delay but these things happen and otherwise a routine flight back across the pond. No problems with Delta."
2147,1,25,October,2015,Economy Class,LHR , TPA , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,Canada,Not Specified,"Last minute flight so I paid $750 CAD for this roundtrip in premium economy. Flight to SFO was smooth - with connection in Seattle. Flight home was bad: I arrived SFO at 11:45 am for 2pm flight. I received a message from Delta that flight was delayed and to contact them. I left the gate, through security, to check-in desk and they advised that the new departure of 2:38 was still good for my connection. Back to the gate, where before boarding an offer was announced to provide a $400 voucher for anyone who would stay behind, which I did not select because I had plans. We boarded at approx 2:30. Approx 2:45 the captain announced we would be held at the gate. We took off at approx 3:10 - at this point I knew I would need to rush to catch connection, which was from different terminal in LAX. We landed LAX &and were held on the tarmac, I deplaned at approx 4:48 to catch departing flight to Calgary Canada on WestJet (codeshare) at 5:05. I obtained assistance through security and ran to the gate in my socks to find the flight gone. I called Delta - they said the next flight would be the next morning. I went back to the other terminal and to the help desk - where we spent over an hour looking at every connection I could find (Vegas, Salt Lake, Vancouver) but every flight had a connection too close to make it home - so I gave in and arranged for the morning flight on WestJet. I asked for Delta to provide me with a Hotel - the answer was no. Supervisor gave me a discount voucher. Next I went downstairs to get my luggage. I was told it was with WestJet and I could not get it because WestJet personnel were not there, but not to worry it would be on my flight tomorrow. I got upset and the very helpful team actually went over got my luggage.  Now it is 8:30pm, 3.5 hours after my flight landed. I entered the website for the hotel, as per directions on the coupon. Site was blank for LAX. I called the phone number on the voucher and was told there was no availability for LAX! I called my husband - who went on the internet to search Airport hotels - everything was showing as FULL or over $350 for a 2 star. Thinking this was only because of how late it was, I called several of these hotels and was told they were indeed booked. I was offered expensive hotels miles away - no shuttle. I needed to be at the airport 2.5 hours before my 8am International flight (because I did not have a boarding pass with the change, I was told to arrive extra early for the flight). So this was unacceptable - I went back up to the Delta help desk to tell them to get me a hotel. I was again told by the supervisor they will not help with a hotel. Agent even left to confirm the voucher was not valid and hotels were indeed booked. I saw they had a flight posted leaving LAX at 9:45pm to Oakland (same are as SFO). I asked to be put on that flight but they would not do it - saying that was 2 legs and I only had 1 leg of my flight left. I had to pay $305 ($400 CAD) for 1 way to OAK, as flight was leaving and decision had to be made. Terrible"
2148,10,25,October,2015,Economy Class,SEA , TPA , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Used Delta Air Lines for the first time, flying from London to New York JFK in October 2015 and I was pleasantly surprised. The flight was on time, boarding was smooth. The supply of food, snack and drinks was really good. The quality of the food was pretty good and they serve pretty big portions too. The plane was a Boeing 767, seats in the economy section are pretty much standard, but more comfortable than other airlines I have used. Entertainment wise, there was a good selection of films and TV series to choose from. Overall it was a very good flight (better than my return flight with Virgin Atlantic) and I would use them again."
2149,8,24,October,2015,First Class,Columbus , New Orleans , ATL     ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I'm submitting this review because of what I thought was outstanding friendly and helpful ground and cabin staff during this trip from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via Dallas Fort Worth. This trip was remarkable for how polite, patient, and free-from-corporate-speak the ticket agent, gate agent, and cabin crew were to me - an experience I had not had with Delta in years past. My flights were punctual and the leg room was tight, but not unreasonable."
2150,4,22,October,2015,Economy Class,Atlanta , Chicago        ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines from Seattle to Anchorage in exit row. Delta has an unusually cramped cabin, even in First Class, so I was relieved to get the exit row. On takeoff, a strip of plastic from the overhead bin compartment fell off and hit me and the guy behind me in the head repeatedly. It was light enough that it was an inconvenience rather than a cause for alarm or injury, but it does call maintenance into question. Then the cabin crew proceeded to serve six bottles of booze to the gentleman seated next to me, despite the fact that he was visibly intoxicated after the first four. Not sure how he'd assist with the emergency exit when he was drunk enough to begin making phone calls as soon as we could see the destination in the distance and yelling obscenities into his phone. Cabin crew ignored this just as they ignored the fact that they over served him beyond any reasonable margin of error. They'd sell him six bottles of tequila, but they only came through the cabin to provide half glasses of ice with a splash of soft drink on a three hour flight. This is on par with what I've come to expect from Delta Airlines. At least I wasn't in First Class this time, and had some leg room (Delta's First Class cabin is as tightly packed as their steerage class rows.)"
2151,9,18,October,2015,Economy Class,Florence , Minneapolis        ,Direct Flight,Business,Spain,Not Specified,"Los Angeles to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. Punctual, comfortable and nice crew, and the flight fulfilled my expectations. The Boeing 717 is a nice and silent plane, especially if you fly first rows. No real catering was offered, but was else can you expect on a 45 minutes flight, just drinks and snacks service. The seats are comfortable, wide and with sufficient distance to the next row. Boarding process fluent and prompt take off. The SkyClub lounge in LAX is fantastic!"

When we landed, the gate was taken so then we missed the last flight of the night. We then had to stay the night in the airport with no accommodation offered. The customer service is absolutely horrible, staff is rude. I say make them sleep on an airport floor for a night, and then tell me they're sorry for the inconvenience. Every gate attendant I dealt with has been rude and not wanting to find flights for us, and acted as though I asked them to do something that was impossible. I would never recommend flying with Delta to my worst enemy. An announcement came over they were offering $500 vouchers for people to give up their seats, when we were offered nothing for them making us miss our flights. To put icing on the cake, they removed our checked bags and now have no idea where they are. Good luck if you fly Delta."

They sent us to a luxury hotel. 4th flight was delayed 1.5 hr (they just realized that the captain had too many hours). What kind of company is this? Will not fly again with them, given a choice."

She has platinum status on Delta, but was unable to obtain an economy comfort upgrade. She was also unable to purchase economy comfort seats (none available), so we ended up in economy. As with the flight from SLC to CDG, the seats in the return CDG to SEA flight were the worst I've experienced - cramped, inadequate padding, solid armrests, and hardly any recline. This was a day flight - I didnâ€™t sleep well the night before, and was unable to take a nap. Seat discomfort made my flight experience miserable. My spouse and I forgot to bring our seat backs to the upright position before landing at SEA, and the FAs didnâ€™t notice. Thatâ€™s how minimal the recline is. Once again, food quality had deteriorated from my last transatlantic Delta flight in January 2014. I forgot to buy take on food at CDG. Delta offered a wide selection of movies, but the free headset's poor sound quality made it impossible to enjoy them. My 1-star rating for entertainment is based on the headsetâ€™s poor sound quality. The FAs were competent and courteous, my only positive comment for this flight."
2156,9,10,October,2015,Economy Class,London , New York       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines from Boston to Indianapolis, and it was just an utter mess.

After delaying constantly for 4 hours and refusing to let us get off the plane while they wait for us to be able to take off. The pilot proceeds to promise we will take off (I don't blame the pilot). The airline said that they would not be allowing my flight to land at LGA due to a lack of space at the airport. The pilot proceeded to ask if we could land in a different airport so that our whole weekends weren't ruined. The airline basically refused to do anything to help myself and several others in the same position. To say the least I am fuming, in tears, and very frustrated with Delta Airlines. Especially since when we were leaving the airplane they were required to play the audio tape ""Thanking for choosing Delta""."

2159,9,8,October,2015,Economy Class,ATL , AMS        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Canada,Not Specified,"First my Delta Air Lines flight got delayed but I was able to re-book it the night before. The guy who answered my call was not very understanding and frustrated me even more. Then the morning of my flight I got there 3 hours early (3:00 am) only to be told that the flight was delayed because the captain was missing. I missed my connecting flight which meant I had to be re routed and had to wait six hours in New York. I was supposed to get to DC at 10 AM and got there at 4:30 pm. Wasted my day at the airport. Coming back, my flight was again delayed and I once again missed my connecting flight. I had to book to another flight. It was a direct flight but basically had to wait 6.5 hours at the airport for it to take off. Then my gate for the new flight got changed twice. Then my 12:22 flight got delayed again to 2:00pm or so. I was supposed to be in Montreal at noon and instead arrived at around 3:10 or so. The one positive was that the direct flight was extremely fast and made it to MontrÃ©al in an hour and 10 minutes. My carry on met the specifications but I was told to leave it on the side of the entrance of the plane because it did not fit in the overhead cabinet? So why do you give specs that do not work? That would be ok except that one of the zippers in my luggage got ripped off and there was a tear on the side of the luggage. Way to take care of my stuff guys. I admit that the staff were very nice and they tried to be understanding. I received a 50$ voucher to use at a later date but will I really use this airline again? Do I want to take a chance? How many delays can a human being take in one trip? They also gave me a 15$ voucher to eat at the airport because I had to wait so long. I understand stuff happens. I understand that sometimes things are out of people's controls. But my experience at Delta was a complete waste of time and either they are extremely incompetent or I am extremely unlucky as a traveller."

The seats in economy are a little cramped. My friend and I are 5ft 10 and 6f t3 and we felt squashed especially when the person in front reclined their chair. However, that was the only negative. The IFE had a good range of movies, and the food was satisfactory. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a good experience. Although, I will book exit row seats the next time. As long as you get to your destination safely, consider it a good flight."

Food was ok usual standard airline fare but choices available, beer and wine was free on the international flights. AVOD on transatlantic flights with a good choice of movies and tv shows, bit disappointed in the audio selection though and this could be improved. Flight attendants passed through the cabin regularly on drink runs offering water or orange juice.

Priority lines were empty and instead of expediting passengers with tight times, everyone was left to work through the full line. Missed flight by 1 minute, and rather than rebook me on next flight they sent me to other side of airport to get on standby. More bad service (no ability to tell me number on standby). I took another train to new flight only to find I was #4 on a full flight. Next available would be three hours later. I left and went to Southwest and bought next flight out which left 20 minutes after the standby flight. Delta service is horrific all the way through starting with gate agents, security staff (not TSA but delta gate staff - one of whom argued with me for 5 minutes on the difference between priority boarding and first. Had they been clearer maybe I would have made flight). Legroom is non existant. People not helpful. Last last last last time I ever fly this awful airline."
2165,8,4,October,2015,Economy Class,Halifax , Salt Lake City      ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"This was hands down the worst travel experience in my life. Apparently the Delta Air Lines flight out of Florence was cancelled to due wind. Delta (and their partner KLM) had my flight bussed to the Pisa airport, (with no explanation, the pilot on the next flight explained). There we were told that we'd be dropped off at our plane that was ""waiting"" and no worries about our connecting flights in Amsterdam. There was no plane waiting in Pisa. We were dropped off with no direction in the Pisa airport parking lot, we had to go back through security and stand in lines trying to figure out which flight we were suppose to take. By the time we made it to Amsterdam the connecting flights were long gone. The KLM/Delta service people, were rude and unhelpful. They would tell us to get in a specific line, where'd we'd wait for over an hour, then they tell us to go to a different part of the airport and get in a different line. The connecting flights that were missed for some reason could not be rebooked at the airport and we were told we had to call Delta ourselves and reschedule. To which, after two attempts at 1.5 hours each spent on hold I was finally able to rebook my flight at an international calling rate of $2 an hour, so I spent over $400 just to rebook the flight. That doesn't include the rest of the costs I incurred at my two days at the airport. And of course they lost my luggage. And of course they don't care. I just keep getting transferred over to different ""customer service lines"" where I have to wait on hold and then repeat everything. So I still don't know where my luggage is and I have a new customer service number that I need to call tomorrow. I hate Delta and KLM and I will try to avoid these airlines if at all possible in the future."
2166,6,4,October,2015,Economy Class,ANC , MIA , ATL      ,Business,United States,Not Specified,This is by far the worst service and flying experience and I will never fly Delta Air Lines again.

Come to find when I check in it won't let me change my seats and no one can seem to help me. On top of all that I had to pay 235$ for my two bags. My advice to anyone thinking about booking with Delta is not to - Southwest are cheaper and all around more comfortable and easier to fly.
2167,9,4,October,2015,Economy Class,Portland , Washington DC ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,We were held up in Nashville for an hour and we were forced to miss our connecting Delta Air Lines flight to Phoenix. On board the flight attendant assured us that the company would put us upon a hotel for the night. They didn't and they would pay for it either. First and last time I fly Delta Air Lines.
2168,8,2,October,2015,Economy Class,Denver , Harrisburg , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I have flown Delta thinking that they were the best. Until my flight from LAX to SLC was rerouted to Grand Junction where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours. I know they cannot help weather, which is not what upsets me. It is that once I finally landed in SLC my next flight to Billings had just taken off.  Again, I know not something they can help. At this point everything for the next 24 hours was booked, there wasn't even a hotel they could get me in for the night. Again, not something that they can control.  So I rented a car and drove through the night on my own accord and expense. The complaint is that when I went to get the ticket refunded I called customer service before even leaving the airport while the flight to Billings was in the air and they insisted that I needed to wait until I completed my flight back to Honolulu before anything could be done. So 2 weeks later, I get back and make a call. Somehow it says that I flew the flight. Every person I called said that they couldn't do anything and gave me another number to call or sent me to the airport. It took me another 2 weeks of calling everyday to find someone who had any idea and knowledge on what to do. I have people telling me to go to the airport and others saying there was no need to go to the airport and they were sorry I was sent there. Well the person who knew what they were talking about, sent me back to the airport and told me who to talk to. I had to get a letter from the airport stating that I didn't fly on that flight. Now, almost a month after getting that paper and 2 months after not getting on that flight, I finally get an email saying it is up for review, but I need a letter from my bank stating that it is okay to give a cash refund. I am so sick and tired of the terrible customer service and the lack of care that 99% of their workers showed. Being that I live in Hawaii, I am 6 hours behind their time, I have had to get up early on my days off just to make sure that I can get through to speak with anyone. I even had a lady say to stay up and call when they open. Oh yes, I am going to stay up till 2am my time to only be frustrated to now end so that I can sleep for 2 more hours and get up to watch children. That sounds like such a grand idea."

I had recently had unexpected surgery earlier in the week and was having so much pain, I called and asked if I could have my flight moved up so I could go home earlier. After I gave them the information to prove my situation they were incredibly kind, and helped me move up the date. I again recently called them because I had purchased tickets for some family members and these had to be changed, and again were kind and refunded my tickets. They went above and beyond and I am very grateful for their kindness. "

I had heard bad things about Delta but my flight with them was extremely pleasant. Food service was extremely prompt, despite sitting near the back of the plane, and the attendants were helpful. Large bottles of water were handed out regularly. As a nurse I was glad to see that they had taken their passenger's health and hydration to heart. It was a much better experience than the Virgin Atlantic flight on the return journey, where I was hungry and thirsty for much of the flight, and the entertainment system crashed multiple times!"
2171,10,28,September,2015,Economy Class,Panama City , Brussels , ATL      ,Business,United States,Not Specified,"We spent $3,000 on these Delta Air Lines tickets and every flight has been very delayed. One of the delayed flights coming home made us miss our connecting flight and the service person told us it was not their fault (air traffic fault), and told us there was nothing they could do. We finally get booked for another flight 24 hours later after not having our luggage and having to buy a hotel, food, clothes, miss work to now find out they have a broken plane. We have been trying to get home now for almost 3 days. We travel all the time and have never experienced such a terrible travel experience and will never give this airline a penny every again."

This flight to ATL was horrible, because of our seats. We got seats at the very last row next to the engines. These seats are horrible and extremely noisy. Although the flight was 1,5 hour, we were still deaf an hour after landing.  There was no inflight service by the cabin crew due to the weather conditions. I've heard this flying on multiple flights by DL. Although flight-safety is priority one, in my opinion there was no trouble with the weather to not deliver cabin service."
2173,9,23,September,2015,Economy Class,SEA , SVO , CDG      ,Couple Leisure,Netherlands,Not Specified,"We went up the Delta Air Lines gate agent and asked for an upgrade or the confirmation we had good seats, as we had missed a lot of sleep due to bad aircraft seats. The DL staff tried to help us out, and we ended up with a middle row (3 seats) for the two of us, which was excellent for us to get some rest on this 8 hour flight home. Boeing 767-400ER with a spacious cabin, comfortable seats, good looking interior and mostly friendly cabin crew. I didn't like the food served. From a quality standpoint it was good, but it just didn't taste good (pasta and chicken)."

Seat was comfortable, plenty of leg room. Boarding not an issue. Full flight but only backpack so no big deal. Snack fine, Delta cookies, candy and drinks. FA's polite. Return was Boeing 757 from SLC to Detroit and A320 from Detroit to Philly. Again 320 was fine, the 757 was older, had not been upgraded so was pretty cramped. Service fine on all flights."
2175,1,23,September,2015,Economy Class,MSP , ICN        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"We were notified 2 hours before our boarding time that our Delta Air Lines flight was cancelled and that we had been rebooked on a flight 5 hours later. After calling a Delta representative for an explanation, she informed us that we had to talk to a ""Delta representative"" which required a 30 minute wait in the airport at their ""special services"" line. This representative told us there was nothing she could do. As a result we missed a show we had spent $200 on. After waiting 7 hours in the airport we boarded our new flight and proceeded to sit at the terminal in a 90 degree hot, full plane, for 30 minutes as they worked on repairs to the plane. They attempted to connect exterior air conditioning to the plane but that unit was also not working. After 30 minutes they told us to grab our luggage and deplane. Currently still waiting at the gate 30 minutes after we were supposed to land in Portland. Never flying Delta again!"
2176,4,22,September,2015,Economy Class,Lafayette , Montego Bay , ATL     ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines royally screwed my entire trip. So first time to go to Vegas and I was so excited. My friend is a platinum member with Delta so we booked our flights with Delta. Our flight was supposed to leave at 3pm and we stayed at the airport until 10pm because there was an every hour delay, finally left and came back in the morning. So one day of our trip which I was supposed to be enjoying in Vegas was lost. We come back the next morning and Delta says that we already got on the plane? We were standing right in front of the lady so we have to wait another 2 hours to get that fixed. Finally got on a plane - get to Vegas late in the day - only to find our luggage lost. So a whole day and half of our trip dealing with plane issues and then only to come to Vegas with no clothes, shoes, or anything.  Last time I will ever book a flight with Delta."
2177,1,22,September,2015,Economy Class,Washington DC , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I sat at GGT for 8 hrs because Delta Air Lines had a mechanical issue. No food, no proper toilet facilities, no proper seating, rude agents and zero communication. Delta provided a $15 credit per person for a dive bar across the street that ran out of food and it was the only place to purchase food. When we complained upon arrival at Atlanta 11 hours later, we were given a 7500 miles for two people."
2178,1,21,September,2015,Premium Economy,RDU , ABQ , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"On my Delta Air Lines flight to Philadelphia from Detroit, the flight attendants were excellent - attentive to passenger needs, upbeat and proactive. Their in-flight review of safety procedures contained a bit of humor, which we enjoyed. During the flight I accidentally pushed the ""call button"" - but I was helped to find the reading light in the dark and there was no criticism. A pleasant experience, after I had been humbled by TSA employees, who really do know how to make flying unpleasant. I cannot recall the names of these flight attendants, but I was on flight DL1749 on Sept. 19, 2015. Thanks!"
2179,1,21,September,2015,First Class,Frankfurt , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,Canada,Not Specified,"Arrived at airport at 3.50 am to find out the flight was ""delayed"" until 4pm later that day, because the plane did not come in the night before. No notification just let us get up and drive to the airport at 3:50am. After some time on the phone we managed to get a milk run to Salt Lake city taking three different flights to get there and only arriving 2 hours later than originally anticipated. Not so bad considering we spent 17 hours traveling from Halifax to Salt Lake. Return flight, they get us to Mey York on time but the connector home is delayed again another three hours. No compensation. Nothing. Lots of I am sorry but this company doesn't value customers time consistently. Claiming weather is the problem in Washington when we are leaving NYC for Halifax and the weather is fine in both spots. I don't understand what Washington rain has to do with it. Very frustrated. My last flight with Delta was the same, lost a days vacation at Walt Disney for a family of five because of mechanical failure and flight cancellation. They provided us 100 dollar travel vouchers each to fly Delta within 1 year that we never got to take advantage of and they expired. Never again will I book a Delta flight."
2180,1,18,September,2015,Economy Class,New York JFK , Moscow      ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"An overall pleasant experience. I upgraded to Delta Comfort+ on the first leg of the journey and chose seats right behind first class bulkhead. There was more than ample leg room. The Comfort+ seats also recline a little further as well, and include priority boarding and free drinks. At ANC airport, there were several other airlines with lines that seemed to go on forever, I think one of them was American. There was no line for Delta and the check in agents were friendly. Flight left on time, landed in ATL on time, and our connecting fight to Miami in a different terminal also was on time. While the MD-80 on the second leg was clean, and seemed to have been refurbished, I do not enjoy flying on those older planes as the cabin pressure is horrible. All bags arrived. Overall again, a pleasant experience. Its nice that Delta serves snacks in economy as well."
2181,2,18,September,2015,Economy Class,San Francisco , Montreal        , Minneapolis St Paul  ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Purchased Delta Air Lines first class tickets from Portland to DC via Salt Lake, leaving at 1:39 pm. At 11:00 am Delta delayed flight so that we would be missing the connection. Their email said they would re-schedule us; the re-schedule was then supposed to be on the red eye, arriving the following day! When we went to ask if there wasn't space on an earlier flight (they had several in the afternoon, going to DC), we were told no - every seat taken. As we sat waiting in the lounge, another passenger overheard our situation and told us she had just been upgraded to first class on one of these flights and there were open seats on them. When we inquired again, the Delta rep admitted that there were in fact first class seats available on those other afternoon flights, but our first class tickets could not be transferred to these seats and they are not allowed to switch us to those seats - different code (?) I feel sorry for the employee who had to explain this embarrassing rip off to us. So after making our original itinerary impossible, Delta's ""code"" policy would not allow us to take available seats on the other afternoon flights, forced us to sit in the Portland airport for 12 hours and then take a red eye flight overnight and arrive 24 hours after our original check in. Nice going Delta. The statement on Delta's rescheduling itinerary form ""we're dedicated to getting you to your destination as soon as possible"" is not true."
2182,8,18,September,2015,First Class,New York , New Orleans      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"My son and I recently flew Delta Air Lines out of Harrisburg to Atlanta, then on to Denver. This was our 3rd annual trip, previously we flew another airline, this year it was Delta. All the staff were courteous and extremely friendly and helpful. It was refreshing and I would recommend Delta and it will be our airline of choice. All of our flights arrived ahead of time."
2183,9,17,September,2015,Business Class,Amsterdam , Orlando        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Afternoon flight on Delta Air Lines from Reagan National to Minneapolis. Initial departure was delayed for a half hour (I did not ask the reason). This was offset by the pleasant service I received gateside. I had a complicated route to take, and I asked to check my carry on (and lo and behold, it arrived at my final destination at the same time I did!). The flight was generally uneventful, flight attendants were courteous, the seats were comfortable. I found the A320 to be a very comfortable plane for economy class, and despite my proximity to premium economy, I didn't see them get excessively pampered. Overall, an  enjoyable trip. The plane was clean (if a bit rattly on touchdown), and I was overall comfortable."
2184,7,17,September,2015,Business Class,Miami , Milan , JFK      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines from Honolulu to Los Angeles on Boeing 767-300, and as this aircraft originated in Japan we were treated to an internationally configured aircraft which provided a comfortable and wonderful flight. The crew, especially the lead, were wonderful and efficient. Food and entertainment were also very good. A positive experience."
2185,10,17,September,2015,Economy Class,Heathrow , New York       ,Direct Flight,Business,Belgium,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines flight from Panama to Atlanta left on time. No welcome greeting when boarding the plane as the stewardess preferred chatting with the pilots in the cockpit. The crew showed a clear lack of interest and were constantly chatting in the galley about their working conditions. They did not bother to close the separation curtain between the cabins during the flight so passengers from the main cabin were eventually queuing up for the business class toilet (why paying business fare?) Breakfast was excellent. The crew on the flight to Brussels was very friendly, very professional. Food was excellent. In spite of the old 767 plane, the business class cabin offers decent comfort, although the seats/beds are a bit cramped indeed. IFE is up to standard."
2186,1,12,September,2015,Business Class,DFW , LGA        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"We flew Delta Air Lines to New York from Manchester in August, and had a wonderful flight where we couldn't fault anything. The seats were comfortable, the inflight entertainment had everything you could want, food was great and the staff were excellent. The Purser on this flight took such great care of us."
2187,1,12,September,2015,Premium Economy,Amsterdam , Guatemala        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I have never been particularly impressed by any US airline but this Delta Air Lines trip to fly Seattle to Moscow via Paris takes the cake in terms of incompetence and lack of accountability. The flight was SEA-CDG-SVO and was initially meant to depart at 1:00pm. First delay was 4 hours for mechanical issues. This meant a rebooking of my connecting flight, no problem. Around 5:00pm, still no plane in sight. Around 6pm, announcement that plane was here and being prepped but needed to be fueled for the trip and the crew is about to be timed out so once the plane is ready, you better be ready to board. No problem. After more than 5 hours and only a couple of slices of cold pizza as compensation, we were ready to get out of there. Once boarded another announcement, some passengers did not board (they were the smart ones), so their bags have to be removed. One hour later, another announcement, as anticipated, crew is about to time out, solution is that we fly to MKE and change crew there (assured that there will be fresh crew in MKE - right). But then there is too much fuel on the plane, as it was meant to be a transatlantic flight. So have to remove some fuel in order to fly to MKE. An hour later, why have we not moved and why has air conditioning on the plane been turned off? They canâ€™t figure out how to remove the excess fuel and turned off air conditioning to facilitate the removal but forgot to turn it back on! So around 9:00pm, rumors start circulating amongst the crew and those standing at the open door and gangway that the flight might be cancelled. At this point, that almost sounds like a blessing. By the time the announcement is made at 9:30pm that the flight is being cancelled, many of those in the know have already left the plane. So a mad rush to get off the plane and get rebooked and situated for the night. At time of rebooking they assure us that the same flight will be OK to go the next day at noon. Put you up at a hotel and here is a $15 meal voucher. Since its 10:00pm already, not a lot open at the airport to get a meal at. But weary and blurry-eyed, we are thankful for anything. Next day, refreshed for a nightâ€™s sleep and hopeful to finally get out of SEA, arrive at the airport again, go through the same drill, get through security, great, flight is still on time, go get coffee and walk to gate. Fellow passenger stops me mid-way to gate and tells me donâ€™t bother, the flight has been cancelled again! Go to customer service and try to get rebooked.  Get to customer service and line is a mile long and not moving. Opt to jump on the phone and try to get a flight. Lady on the phone rebooks me on a flight SEA-MSP-AMS-SVO. Thatâ€™s one more leg than Iâ€™d like but heck, get me out of SEA! It is now 11:26am, the flight to MSP is scheduled to depart at 11:30am from a gate that I have to take an airport train to get to. Booking agent assures me that the departure time is actually 11:50am so I have time. Finally get rebooked, rush to gate. Get there at 11:32am. Gate has closed!  Gate agent firmly states that flight was scheduled for 11:30, I am late and doors are closed. At this point, I am near tears. How do I get out of this airport?? My one piece of luck, the gate agent actually relents and reopens gate to let me on."

Departure from Orlando was delayed due to airport closure for lightning, the aircraft was an old Boeing 757-200 and age was clearly showing. There was no meal service even in first class, but the service was good, the Delta Airlines ground staff receiving the flight at Detroit were not interested in helping us with the connecting flight to Amsterdam - until one official at a different gate helped out. Detroit to Amsterdam flight was a newly refitted Boeing 767-400 with nice business class beds but the monitor screen was small and could not compare with competing airlines. I selected the vegetarian option on the food which was a cannelloni with goat cheese on a bed of spinach, a very bland and uncooked dish, the bottom half of the pasta was dry and hard  there was a sprinkle of marinara sauce - not even enough to taste let alone to moisturize the pasta. Breakfast was a cereal which was OK. IFE selection was better than average on the international sector. Both sectors had a very good WIFI connection."
2189,2,10,September,2015,Economy Class,BHM , SFO , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul to Seoul Incheon, and Delta Air Lines staff and service has continued to improve over the last year. Ground staff and flight crew were all friendly and attentive. Inflight entertainment options are among the best and I like that you can access it before you are airborne and after you land and are taxiing. Seats are not comfortable especially on a transpacific flight but the added legroom of Economy Comfort is worthwhile."
2190,1,9,September,2015,Premium Economy,AMS , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by Delta's first class service from Lafayette to Montego Bay via Atlanta. Our LFT-ATL flight was operated with a Boeing 717 that appeared to be new inside, but was in fact a refurbished aircraft. The flight attendant greeted us warmly and professionally. There were pillows, blankets and bottled water at every seat in first class. On time departure and arrival. It would have been nice to have been served a hot breakfast snack on this 6:00am departure; however, only small snacks were offered. We made a quick 40 minute connection at ATL with no problem. Our ATL-MBJ flight was operated with an older Boeing 757-200 that had some age on it but was still in good condition with regard to first class cabin. Once again, we were greeted professionally and pillows, blankets, water at every first class seat. We were also greeted with a glass of sparkling wine. The breakfast burrito was pretty good as was fresh fruit served with breakfast. Beverages were kept topped up on a regular basis. Arrived just a few minutes late and our bags were among the first off the plane."

They say you can choose at check-in but there is no option to do so when you check-in online. Flew Washington DC to Atlanta, I ended up at the back of the plane for a flight which I had purchased 3 months in advance. Also, you can't use the e-pass which makes getting your boarding pass a lot more difficult."
2192,9,9,September,2015,Business Class,JFK , Salt Lake       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Czech Republic,Not Specified,"Delta Air Lines flight from Raleighâ€“Durham to Albuquerque via Atlanta was delayed 1hr 25min waiting for crew to arrive on another flight. Then came the aircraft change. I purchased a First Class ticket and was seated in seat 4B before the change. After  change I was seated in Economy Comfort seat 16C. When the flight finally left RDU seats 5B/5C were empty, yet having paid for First Class I was left in Economy Comfort seat 16C. Arrived in ATL and discovered my flight to ABQ was still there, the reason, waiting for flight crew from my flight from RDU to ATL. Rode First class ATL-ABQ, however, my 2 bags didn't ride at all. One stayed in ATL and the other took a flight to SLC. The 2 bags did arrive at 1 PM the next day. Not a happy passenger. Biggest problem with Delta was nobody cared or wanted to hear about my problem. I think I am finished with Delta."
2193,1,7,September,2015,Economy Class,Minneapolis , San Francisco       ,Direct Flight,Business,Germany,Not Specified,"It was good value for the money that I spent for this Delta Air Lines flight from Frankfurt to New York JFK. The new Business Elite Seats are good, the IFE seems to have some updates and run smoother than last time. You may complain that the lie-flat seat has a real narrow room for your feet, but value for money was good. I would have paid â‚¬200 more for Singapore Airlines on the same route, but I was too late. Delta is always a good option if you get a Z or J fare."
2194,4,7,September,2015,Economy Class,BGI , BOS , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"There have been a lot of negative comments of Delta Air Lines business Elite seats and I initially thought of them as being overly critical, until I had a first hand experience on my recent flight from JFK to Moscow. The seats are narrow, but so are many other airlines. What I liked was the configuration with single seats in a zigzag pattern on either side of the plane giving privacy to single travelers. Not much storage space, though. It's the tunnel like part of the pod where one's legs go in when the seat is in full flat position. The space is so confined that it's impossible to keep the feet straight up, forcing a person to lie on one's back only, unable to bend knees, requiring a contortionist skills to attempt sleeping on the side. The feeling is actually of being forced into a very narrow coffin. I honestly could never imagine being so uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a plane. I wonder if anyone at Delta actually tested the seats before installing them, certainly would fire those responsible for the decision! It ruined an otherwise highly pleasant flight, with professional and attentive crew, good and tasty food and extensive entertainment choices."
2195,7,7,September,2015,Economy Class,JFK , YVR        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Flew Delta Air Lines from San Francisco to Montreal via Minneapolis/St Paul. I gave this trip 6/10 because the first flight was terrible, but the second was great. On the first flight, everything went wrong. My seat didn't recline, the flight attendants frequently ignored me, my window was stuck, there was no entertainment system whatsoever, and the flight arrived late at Minneapolis, which left me no time to get lunch. The second flight was better. The seats were spacious, the flight attendants were friendly, and best of all, my seat reclined. The only bad part is that we arrived late, yet again, but that's kind of a Delta signature move. I recommend this airline because it's a great low cost carrier for international travel, and it has never let us down before."
2196,8,4,September,2015,Economy Class,New York , New Orleans      ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Italy,Not Specified,"The connection was not managed by Delta but by its subsidiary Endeavor Air. The airplane was new and clean. I was skeptical about this company as it was the first time I flow it, but I have to admit it was very good. I will rate very low the ground service, thinking more about Delta than to Endeavor Air. Our original flight in the evening was cancelled and Delta did not provide any support to find an Hotel and to get at least a discounted fare."
2197,1,4,September,2015,Economy Class,Las Vegas , Orlando , Atlanta     ,Family Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"We have flown Delta Air Lines a number of times for the past four years mainly due to the availability of carriers on the dates we require. We will not be booking with them again as things are getting worse. We flew from Amsterdam to Orlando via Minneapolis and again were seated separately as a family, although we booked last year. Online check in did not allow seat allocation as system not available. Staff friendly, food good all considered. On enquiring why we were seated separately we were told because we booked online via a travel agent. I have travelled with many major airlines and have never had this problem. Coming back we checked in online. All okay, phone call automated saying flight was delayed 30 mins, no problem but at check in we were told that our flight was for the next day? So we went to customer services who apologised, and after 5 hours got on a flight with a different carrier via Germany to home taking 35 hours later! I have to say this is the last straw, our flight from Australia to home last year was shorter. We will not be flying with Delta again. Very dissappointed."
2198,1,4,September,2015,Economy Class,Denver , Philadelphia , Minneapolis      ,Couple Leisure,Italy,Not Specified,"Inside the Delta aircraft the cabin has been renewed, each seat has TV screen with a large selection of films (I mean films in Italian ). The seat is comfortable and it is reclining. Cabin crew is very helpful and kind, but the food is not so good. Aircraft is quiet and they give you a pair of earplugs and an eye shade. I was satisfied by Delta Air Lines."
2199,1,2,September,2015,Economy Class,LAX , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Excellent service with Delta Air Lines. Plane food normally isn't enjoyable but thoroughly enjoyed on this flight. Staff were friendly and wished me a happy birthday while aboard. Entertainment variety was fantastic, and I would fly Delta again. Much better than Virgin Atlantic, plenty of leg space and very clean too."
2200,10,2,September,2015,Economy Class,Seattle , Hawaii        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"This flight with Delta Air Lines was the worst service I have received. The plane was filthy. There was trash all over the place. The flight attendant was rude. When she started to hand out beverages I asked if I could have a can of Coke and she told me that because of other incompetent flight attendants, she didn't have enough drinks and would only give me a cup. We arrived 20 minutes later than scheduled, which left us 15 minutes to catch our connecting flight out of Detroit to DFW. The pilot never let us know our gate. We were told to look at the monitor when we got off the plane. My 60 year old mother and I had to run 46 gates in 15 minutes, only to arrive at the wrong gate because it had been listed incorrectly. When we arrived at the correct gate with 7 minutes to spare, they had already closed the plane doors and were preparing to take-off. I had to make a huge scene in order for them to re-open the plane doors and let us on the flight. They finally did once I brought up that we were not late and that they were leaving early. After nearly 10 hours of horrible service, we finally arrived in New York. I will never fly Delta Air Lines again."
2201,1,1,September,2015,First Class,ATL , SEA        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,Netherlands,Not Specified,"Biggest problem is the transit in Atlanta. What a hell. More than 1 hour in line for passport control. Running to catch the connecting flight. Delta Air Lines staff seem uninterested, not very unfriendly. In-flight entertainment of very low quality and the touch screen hardly worked."
2202,8,31,August,2015,Economy Class,LAX , YVR        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"I wasn't impressed with Delta when we flew from Seattle to London Heathrow via Minneapolis. No over the head earphones so my husband who uses a hearing aid and only has hearing in one ear could not use the entertainment system at all. The entertainment systems were very small and some touch screens didn't work very well. Mine kept blinking on and off every two seconds which made watching a film difficult. The plane was freezing cold to the point where both me and my husband were physically shivering and it meant we could not sleep on the 9 hour journey at all. We alerted staff of our discomfort several times but they ignored us and the temperature stayed the same. On the shorter flights (3 hours Seattle to Minneappolis) there are entertainment systems but you have to pay $2 for headsets to use them. We tried to purchase a snackbox on board, but they wouldn't accept cash and would only accept card, which would have meant our bank charging us fees. Despite having only one hour changeover to check in for our next flight and go through security at Seattle, we got on the flight, but the airline managed to fail to send our bags, meaning we got them 26 hours after we should on arriving home. I have experienced much better service on other economy services on other airlines."
2203,3,29,August,2015,Business Class,Savannah , Los Angeles , ATL     ,Business,United States,Not Specified,"BHM-ATL was okay, short (25 mins) but had welcome drink and time for one in the air. Fairly tight connection in ATL, so I was last to board first class cabin. I could see all other passengers had welcome drinks, but no-one offered me one. When I asked I was told I was too late!  Things got worse from there. When asked what I wanted to eat the choice was steak or lasagne. I asked what came with the steak and was asked what I meant. I said I meant what comes with the steak? Not a difficult question I thought. So the FA goes back to the galley (I could see it all happen from my seat), opens a foil tray and comes back to my seat with one word - carrots! Talk about taking care of the customers. Eventually when my food arrived, sauce had been spilled all over and somehow under the tray. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but needless to say I didn't eat it! I've seen this kind of behavior before when FA's seem to vent on a customer for unknown reasons - I guess I drew the short straw on this flight. Generally I find Delta an pretty good airline, but this was not their best moment."
2204,10,27,August,2015,Economy Class,Reagan National (Washington DC) , Tokyo , Minneapolis   ,Solo Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"All in all, a very good flight. Yes, the aircraft is old but has been nicely retrofitted by Delta to include modern IFE (with a decent selection included), and fairly comfortable, if firm, seats (use the complimentary pillow as a backrest if you need extra comfort). I had a window seat in the 2-3-2 layout, so much less cramped than other widebody aircraft. The crew were friendly and welcoming, and delivered a full service throughout the flight. Also, great value considering it was booked just two months before. Would definitely fly Delta again."
2205,8,27,August,2015,Economy Class,Philadelphia , Dallas Ft Worth     , Atlanta     ,Solo Leisure,Japan,Not Specified,"I'm usually very generous with my flight reviews of Delta. I'm a Gold elite and they are the airline of choice to and from the US for me. I think my loyalty has hit a wall. The good: the flight attendants are professional and the entertainment is pretty good as is the schedule options to and from the US from Japan. The bad: old planes, hard seats in business, small AVOD screens, dirty toilets, captains constantly using toilets in business class so passengers are blocked, mediocre food. On top of this, baggage snafu in ATL caused my travel partner and I to miss our connection on the way to RDU and they would not put us on the next available flight until I threw a fit. That's customer service in the US. You have to behave badly to be treated well. I'm considering the hot Japanese carriers on my next trip where I know the food and seats are superior. By the way, my ticket from NRT to ATL was an award ticket. I cannot imagine anyone paying over $5,000 for such an inferior product."
2206,9,26,August,2015,Business Class,Chicago , Cincinnati       ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Its been 12 years since I've flown Delta. It will be another 12 before I even consider it again. Delta was horrible 12 years ago and has only gotten worse. Seats were filthy. We were told we had to check our carry on's because there was no room in the overhead compartments. When we boarded we saw that every compartment on both sides of the aisle behind, above and in front of our seats were totally empty. We waited 35 minutes to get our luggage. I unfortunately lost my cell phone at the gate and although I filed a report have been unable to get any information regarding my property. Humans are unavailable to speak to. Damn me if I get another Delta flight."
2207,8,25,August,2015,Economy Class,Orlando , Detroit        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,Australia,Not Specified,Just arrived after having the worst flight I have ever been on. Delta should lose the seat outside the toilets so you don't have to have inconsiderate people trying to push you over to the next seat with their behinds. This would also make it easier for food service trolleys to get by with out taking out your shoulder.
2208,10,23,August,2015,Economy Class,Seattle , Portland        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Our flight to Barbados from BOS went well with the exception of the dreadful egg wrap on the BOS-ATL leg. We were able to use the Delta lounge before departing BOS since we were in business class. On the return BGI-BOS via ATL flight, ATL Delta Lounge personnel informed us that ""flights to Barbados are not considered international."" Although our ATL to BOS leg was delayed over two hours (until an 11.15 pm departure), we could not use the Lounge unless we paid a $29 fee per person which we declined. Overall, our expense of flying Business or First Class to the Caribbean was not justified by the service, the food, or other amenities in the air or in the airport. Others should be aware that just because you need a passport to get into your destination, it's not Delta's definition of ""international."""
2209,2,23,August,2015,First Class,Newark , Nairobi , Amsterdam      ,Business,United States,Not Specified,"Both outbound and inbound flights, in the evening/night, were more or less on schedule. What was surprising was on these 6 hours' long flights there was no food service, not even the food-for-sale, advertised on a card in the seat pocket. Yes, a packet of peanuts or pretzels were handed out. Furthermore, there was only one drinks service during the long flight. Catering really could be improved on this long, international flight. The plane was old with a minimalist entertainment system; there was a TV monitor hanging at intervals in the cabin and a movie was played. Free headsets were distributed. The crew distributed Canada immigration forms on board but did not have enough for all. I chose these flights for being non-stop but in retrospect, might have enjoyed the journey with a stop-over or flown a different carrier (e.g., Cathay Pacific) instead."
2210,6,23,August,2015,Economy Class,New York , Miami       ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta is a standard airline, flight quality is average, but there customer service is so poor. I have been a Delta SkyMiles member for years and have had a few problems here and there but nothing serious until today. I tried to switch my connecting flight to New Orleans to a direct flight where there are 10 open economy seats. I was told that there were only first class seats and after showing the people at the Delta kiosk that they were wrong they got on the phone and then told me it was too late to switch even though the flight I would like to switch to does not board for two hours. The whole process took about 30 minutes and the staff was not the least bit sincere. I won't arrive into New Orleans until midnight, even though there are 10 empty seats on a flight that lands at 9.30. Terrible customer service, and genuinely poor business practices."
2211,7,19,August,2015,Economy Class,BDL , RSW , Atlanta      ,Family Leisure,Qatar,Not Specified,"We took an afternoon flight and arrived close to midnight, though both planes were older 757-200 and did not have any personal entertainment system but you could see that the aircraft's were well maintained, the leather seats were all in good working condition and showed no age, though the food selection did not entertain vegans but the drink selection was very wide. The cabin staff were all helpful and the Internet was a huge plus. One of the nice things is we forgot one piece of cabin luggage on our first flight and we told the cabin staff of the second flight and they told operations and they transferred the piece to us so we where surorised to see it on the belt with our checked baggage."
2212,9,19,August,2015,Economy Class,ORD , PSA , DTW and AMS    ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Delta, as a whole, was very inconsiderate of the 'paying' customers. Measly snacks, hard seats, cold cabin, and when it comes to connecting flights - forget it. We were connecting to another Delta plane, which was the last to the east coast for the night and they refused to hold the flight despite the arriving flight from Denver being delayed. The ""help"" they gave us was useless and to say their customer service was inconsiderate would be an understatement"
2213,5,18,August,2015,Economy Class,Clermont Ferrand , Newark , Paris      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Flight was delayed, the seats are very uncomfortable to sleep in as the headrest does not stay in place. Staff acted irritated when I asked them about this. The extra legroom seats feel very narrow, and I'm 160 lbs and 5'11"". The plane was freezing the entire flight, and the entertainment system was not working for the first 2 hours of the flight. An awful experience for $850."
2214,4,18,August,2015,First Class,Tampa , Boston        , Detroit      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"My family and I were getting ready to fly to Hawaii on a family vacation. Due to mileage reasons, we had to fly Delta though we usually fly Alaska. When we arrived at the airport and checked in at the Delta front desk to check our bags, they're seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding our 3 hour layover in San Jose. However, the lady at the desk assured us that everything was cleared up and our bags would make it on the plane with us. After a 3 hour flight delay and having to get off the plane because a flight attendant got injured, we finally took off, barely making our connecting flight in San Jose (we landed at 6.10, got off at 6.20 and our flight was taking off at 6.35). We had to sprint to our connecting flight. After arriving in Hawaii, our bags never arrived at baggage claim. We weren't too concerned at first, thinking that the bags probably just didn't make our connecting flight in San Jose but would be sent over shortly after. After waiting for the next flight arriving from Seattle to see if our bags came on that flight, they never did. Long story short, we ended up never getting our bags until 4 days after arriving in Hawaii. The whole thing was an absolute nightmare and my family and I will never be flying Delta again."
2215,8,18,August,2015,Economy Class,JFK ," Manchester, UK       ",Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Flew DL2039, ATL to SEA in economy class on August 4 and DL2327, SEA to ATL in Comfort Plus on August 11. Flight attendant crew on both flights were engaging with the passengers and provided great service. Was able to purchase meals both ways, which were very good. Flights departed and arrived on time. Especially nice was the video on demand with a wide selection of programs to watch. Added cost of Comfort Plus was worth it, with priority boarding, upgraded free snack and free alcoholic beverages if desired."
2216,8,17,August,2015,Economy Class,Bozeman , Las Vegas , Salt Lake City   ,Solo Leisure,New Zealand,Not Specified,"Flew LAX to YVR. Check-in at LAX was actually a wonderful experience. Checked-in at the dedicated first class area, staff were polite and helpful. Departure from LAX was delayed one hour. On board the seat was filthy, seat pocket full of dirty napkins and plastic from the previous flight. The fast turn around in LA obviously did not include a cleaning of the cabin. Cabin crew seemed very inexperienced. Only one flight attendant serving first. Took meal and drink order one at a time, then went back and very slowly prepared it. I cannot say she was rude, but she was not pleasant either. Just robotic in her job. No offer of second drinks, or any ongoing service for the rest of the flight. She just stood in the galley, playing with her phone. When we were close to descent for Vancouver, I asked her if we were going to receive any arrival documentation for customs. She replied, ""oh yeah, I forgot about that!"" She and her coworker than proceeded to distribute the forms as we began our descent. Arrived in Vancouver about 45 minutes late. All in all, the fare was cheap, but so was the service. Perhaps I expect too much from North American based airlines."
2217,5,15,August,2015,Premium Economy,SJC , BCN ," SEA, ATL     ",Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"First we flew LAX to Savannah via Atlanta. The plane was late every step of the way. My twin 9 year olds and I were going for a small vacation, then to pick up a dog in Valdosta, GA and back home to LA. The LAX personnel with only one exceptional woman were surly and unhelpful. Because I was picking up a dog on the way back, I couldn't pick up my boarding pass electronically. The lines for help were long and the electronic rejection gave no answer. I tried to get help from 3 different Delta personnel, these were women who were recounting their evenings the night before and had no desire and felt no need to interrupt their gossip with work. Finally I found a friendly face among in the Delta line-up and this woman helped. The air crew was surly. Didn't think it was their job to help put up a bag. Turned up her little nose when my son asked for a drink. Atlanta to Savannah they held us on the tarmac 2 hours. Horrible. The way back was even worse. They were nice enough in Valdosta - which is so tiny they sort of have to be - nevertheless they body-searched an 80 year old woman in security. As usual the plane was delayed at Atlanta. Here there was no help available once you got there. Surly personnel. As a Amex Platinum card carrier, I was told I had the right to use the Delta Lounge. Since I was carrying a puppy and had my boys, we went to the lounge. The rude pretentiousness was shocking, and they refused to let us in the lounge. I called Amex and filed a protest and they called - but at that point I'd seen the pitiful offerings and decided to take the kids to PF Changs. The flight to LA was delayed 1.5 hours. When I got to the gate, I asked the girl at the desk what time the plane would actually board. The rude young women snapped at m: ""I just said that it would be in 1/2 an hour..."" I answered her: Obviously I just got here and didn't hear you or I wouldn't ask. Really, Delta? This is who you consider an appropriate employee? That's professional? Other passengers were complaining about her and about her male cohort. To board the plane it was complete chaos. Like being in a Third World country with a free-for-all at boarding - starting from the front rather than the back - so there is the inevitable bottleneck, and no clear instructions anyway. Again the flight crew think they're above helping with a bag. They're too busy to bring a meal mid-flight - for a child! Surliness, snootiness. Bad attitude. I thought United was bad. Delta is the worst. If I can avoid it, I'm not going back."
2218,9,14,August,2015,Economy Class,Atlanta , London Heathrow       ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"The flight was okay in general. However, staff service could be better and food could be highly improved. I go to Japan a lot and I'm used to stellar Japanese service, so I never had high hopes for service, but cabin crew were a little rude at times. I left a drink for them to collect and they were saying something like ""It seems like a waste"" and then took the drink. Not that I could finish it because it was right before landing. Very cold plane in my view. Seats were okay and IFE was okay. Dinner was regular but breakfast was terrible. The egg and sausage looked and tasted worse than a fast food restaurant. I could not get a return flight for a good price, and I don't know about other airlines, but when I changed my flight for a second time due to illness, they charged you 4k or more just for economy. No upgrades or anything. I ended up switching to another airline to get home. Again I was not too happy with Delta, but I wasn't expecting Japan-level service. Probably the best airline overall in terms of international travel in the USA."
2219,3,13,August,2015,First Class,SLC , ATL        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I liked the check-in systems when I reached PHL. When I boarded the plane, I sat in Premium Economy. There was no IFE on the flight, so I passed the time by sleeping and enjoying the view. Scheduled flight time was 2 hrs 17 mins from PHL to ATL. Once I arrived in ATL we went on The Plane Train from Concourse A to Concourse T where my flight from ATL to DFW was departing from. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed. It was supposed to depart at 11.30am local time but delayed to 12.16pm. Therefore the flight arrival in DFW was also delayed, from 12.45pm local time to 1.26pm. Scheduled flight time was 2 hrs 45 mins."
2220,8,12,August,2015,Economy Class,MKE , New York La Guardia ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"I'm a loyal Diamond Delta customer that finds myself using United and other airlines of late. Delta has trimmed so many flights by day of week that I can't use them. Three weeks in a row I have gone elsewhere. Trying to book Detroit next week, a hub, and I can't because there are no seats. Delta Air Lines zeal to cut capacity means losing the loyalty of a very loyal customer."
2221,10,10,August,2015,Economy Class,Winnipeg , Grand Rapids , MSP     ,Solo Leisure,Singapore,Not Specified,"Flying on Delta's 757-200 on the Orlando - Detroit route is like flying in a coffin. This plane should be in the museum and not in the air. The plane is old. First class seats are ancient. Cabin is falling apart - the protective plexiglass window by my seat was cracked on the side. The service was dated. The red blanket given was made out of pure synthetics giving me so much static electricity. The only good part to the flight was that the breakfast wasn't all that bad. Besides all that, with a purchased first class ticket, we were not allowed to use their Sky Club lounge. Wasn't expecting much - but got even less than that."
2222,1,10,August,2015,Economy Class,SAN      ,LHR , JFK      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"We were notified 2 hours before our boarding time that our flight was cancelled and that we had been rebooked on a flight 5 hours later. After calling a Delta representative for an explanation she informed us that we had to talk to a ""Delta representative"" which required a 30 minute wait in the airport at their ""special services"" line. This representative told us there was nothing she could do. After waiting 7 hours in the airport we boarded our new flight and proceeded to sit at the terminal in a 90 degree full plane for 30 minutes as they worked on repairs to the plane. They attempted to connect exterior air conditioning to the plane but that unit was also not working. After 30 minutes they told us to grab our luggage and disboard. Currently still waiting at the gate 30 minutes after we were supposed to land in Portland. Never flying Delta again!"
2223,4,9,August,2015,Economy Class,MIA , AMS , ATL      ,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"First time flying Delta. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. Food was average. Cabin door closed on time, but waited about half an hour before we left the ground, still arrived on time. Overall the flight was better than average except for the seat. I was in premium economy and when you recline the seat back, the seat itself also moves forward. This initially seemed like a nice reclined position. However with no foot rest, this position created severe strain on my low back, and gave me a backache. I thought it was a fluke. However the same thing happened on the return flight. I loathe taking extra paraphenilia on a plane for ""flight comfort"" but you might need to consider lumbar support for long haul flights on this plane. On return to the US, I went through the immigration kiosk and my bags were on the carousel 5 minutes later."

Made for an uncomfortable trip and both times we spent more than 20 minutes waiting for luggage both going to Hartford and coming back from Hartford. I know they talk about 2500 miles if you wait more than 20 minutes for luggage but we haven't received any word on that. We've flown Delta in the past. But definitely will have second thoughts before using them again."
2226,3,2,August,2015,Economy Class,ATL , SFO        ,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I flew with Delta from Chicago O'hare to Pisa via Detroit and Amsterdam. Between the big three American airlines (United, AA, and Delta), Delta would be my favorite. On all the flights they were organized, fast and on-time. From Chicago to Detroit, which was flown on a crj900, lasted only an hour but they still handed out snacks and drinks. On that flight my family and I were put in Comfort+ for no extra charge. Comfort+ had very nice legroom and very good seat width. The long haul flight from Detroit to Amsterdam was flown with a 767-400, which is in my opinion the nicest plane that Delta flies. With a 2-3-2 layout and me traveling in a party of 3 made it so we traveled in the middle section and were still undisturbed by an extra person next to us. It made the entire flight feel a whole lot more private. The IFE systems were great and had plenty of movies to watch. Were left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This made it super easy to catch my connection. At Amsterdam we had plenty of time to relax and explore the airport. We had to fly with Transavia, one of the low-cost carriers linked with KLM, and that was slightly chaotic in boarding but comfortable inflight. We arrived on time and I'm impressed with the quality of Delta."

We had to stay on the aircraft from 3pm until 11pm with malfunctioning air-conditioning and toilets. During this time we received one small cheese sandwich and a chocolate bar. The Delta Hub in Atlanta said they would send a plane, then after 3 hours of waiting, the pilot received word that it had not even taken off. When the 'rescue plane' finally arrived after everyone (260 approx) being in the plane for 8 hours, we sat on the rescue plane for another 50 minutes until we finally took off at 12.10am. I arrived at Newark to find my bag had been sent to Atlanta. Because of all of this I missed a connecting flight. I write this from Newark airport, still not reaching my destination of LA. This is not the first time I have had an issue with Delta."

Flight landed at Detroit around 2.55, for a 3.20 connection. Talked to the flight attendent, who assured us multiple times that we would be able to make it to our connection. We ended up being excessively late. I normally wouldn't be upset about something like this, but I have been on several flights where they let off people that needed to reach a connection quickly. There was an available solution and the employee failed to use it."

The flight in itself was nice, both legs were short but I was more comfortable with the older 757-200 seats from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas but they were quite similar, since they were both short flights. There was no meal service but a choice of pretzels or nuts or biscuits and the attendants were allowing us to have more than one thing. All bags came through without issue and on time."
2231,2,31,July,2015,Economy Class,BOS , CDG        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"The original reservation was SJCâ€“ATLâ€“BCN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCNâ€“ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights. I'm a former frequent flyer of United and American airlines, who never handled their flight delays nearly as reasonably and promptly as Delta did."

The cost of the tickets was outrageous for a 2 hr flight but it was a present for my daughters so I reluctantly paid it because it had desirable departure times and no layovers. The flight was to leave at 9.35 am. They texted at 5 am to say the flight was delayed until 11.11. Just as I was walking out the door I noticed another text saying it was now going out at 12.15. As long as I had time I decided to check in online. There I was informed that my flight had been cancelled but 'don't worry, we've rebooked you on a different flight. Yes, one that leaves at 5.03 pm, lays over in Cleveland and doesn't arrive in NY until 10.00 pm.

I ask a question and keep getting a standard response which you can see is taken from a general sheet 'how to answer questions' which does not fit my question at all. And I can't seem to get one contact and one email from anyone to answer. It's now going back and forth since 14 emails and 2 calls and I have not received a response as per why they did what they did. Very disappointing.
2237,1,21,July,2015,Business Class,SEA , New York JFK      ,Direct Flight,Business,Netherlands,Not Specified,"Got delayed from PAP, missed the connection and rerouted via MIA then ATL back to AMS. Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure. The Lost Luggage staff were very nice in fixing this quickly"
2238,9,21,July,2015,Economy Class,Boston , New York       ,Direct Flight,Business,United States,Not Specified,"This is not an acceptable C class. The seats feel short, the pitch is tight and you really can't recline much if you want to somewhat respectful of the person behind you. Service is basic, no cocktails, no nuts, a plate of just about edible dinner with a glass of undrinkable wine right after take off. Engine noise is deafening. Hard to believe that Delta is able to deliver credible premium service on other routes. On the plus side, the FAs were personable, the southbound itinerary is convenient and the flight ran on time."
2239,5,21,July,2015,First Class,Philadelphia ," Santiago, Dom Republic      ",Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with. We chose Delta and the route because it had the best connections but next time we'll avoid Delta long haul."
2240,2,20,July,2015,First Class,AUS , SEA , LAX      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I was warmly greeted on entering the aircraft. The service was excellent, always with a smile. However, the cabin was very warm and noisy (we were seated over the engines). My wife had a window seat while I had a middle seat. EC is worth the money. I purchased a snack box which was just enough to keep away hunger pains, but nothing to brag about. The WI FI did not function until 2 hours into flight. However, Delta is certainly better than their competitors."
2241,4,19,July,2015,Economy Class,SEA , AUS , MSP      ,Business,United States,Not Specified,"Delta is running a scam by calling this cabin first class. The seats, although slightly wider than in coach, do not recline, have no footrests, no phone or computer chargers. The leg room is only about 5 inches more than in coach. On my outbound flight, I had to pay for watching movies or television-any kind of television. The food is inedible. I've flown premium economy on other airlines (BA, Virgin Atlantic) that was much better than this."

Our pre-order Muslim meal was delivered and it was a very filling and flavorful vegetarian sandwich. The cabin crew were very friendly and the entertainment system was very good. The seats left a lot to desire, a business class seat on flydubai was more comfortable which is a low cost airline, Delta need to look on upgrading these seats on their new orders from Airbus."

Long story short our plane was scheduled for a routine engine change on account of reaching so many miles. No one in the tower or the boarding team was aware of this. No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't. Eventually they got a a new plane and it left 2.5 hours late. I had a connection flight that I missed as a result."

Thanks to Delta, my wife and I have to sleep in a really nasty hotel room somewhere in nowhere Detroit because they were unwilling to help put us up for the night. Their advice was to take the Sky Miles packs and spend the night in the airport. Thanks for the toothbrush. Help with my luggage? Nope! We don't recommend trying to get your luggage off whatever belt it may have been diverted too. Help with a room? Nope. Take your travel kits and be on your way! Make a phone call to try to obtain help? Nope! Person on the other end of the line can't really speak very good English. $1200 got me stuck in Detroit on my way to Kansas City, in the nastiest room ever, without mine and my wife's medication because Delta take your money, but don't provide any quality of service."

Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra Â£50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy. Overall I'm pleased with my experience and would recommend Delta to others."
2246,6,14,July,2015,Economy Class,Key West , Atlanta        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Booked Delta via UK agent over 3 months in advance, despite early booking we had no choice of seating, sat near back of plane, Delta customer service re moving forward no response until day of flight then lip service, leaking air valve overhead and uncomfortable hard seats. Same for return flight via JFK, worse still Delta charge for checked baggage for internal flight (rip-off) as paid in full for complete journey, over a $1000 each for economy. One lady only doing everything on both sides of plane, so long waits. Ear phones useless for films. Will book elsewhere in future."
2247,3,14,July,2015,Economy Class,Huntsville , Denver        ,Direct Flight,Couple Leisure,Australia,Not Specified,Delta suprised us-we selected this airline because of the width of the seats. We flew Sydney to Calgary via LAX and Seattle on the first leg and then coming home LAX to Sydney. Check-in staff (queues moved quickly) and customer service was excellent at all airports. Cabin staff were efficient and friendly - meals were reasonable. Entertainment system was okay - enough to keep us occupied on the long flights. Only issue we had was when one of our bags didn't arrive in Calgary - spoke to service desk and staff assured us that it would be found.

Waited on the taxiway for 20 minutes prior to takeoff, allegedly due to a stoppage at Laguardia, the connecting city. One bathroom on the plane, which was dirty. Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay.  We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members. They went to the customer service desk in the private Skyclub to try to get something in the way of a comp. No satisfaction. They asked for a supervisor, who refused to even come to the service desk. Delta doesn't give a damn about customer service."
2251,1,11,July,2015,First Class,JFK , FLL        ,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I was scheduled to fly SEA-SFO-JFK. Flight to SFO was delayed by 30 minutes, which meant I would miss my connecting flight to JFK. I was notified by emaila phone call and through the app that my flight was delayed. Within one click of the app, I was offered alternate flights, even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good, on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old, the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly. Entertainment options excellent, with entire seasons of my favorite TV shows. WiFi was fast, although I recommend buying the 24-hour pass on the DL website or app as it's much more expensive onboard. Overall, a pleasant experience onboard but DL did a fantastic job handling the delay on the ground."

Purchasing a first class ticket does not allow you to use the Delta lounge Boston airport. There are a number of exclusions that were not disclosed when the ticket was purchased.

2253,8,9,July,2015,Economy Class,DSM , LHR , MSP      ,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I was flying out on vacation with my husband and 2 children. Our flight was supposed to leave on June 24 at 6.05am with a connection in JFK at 9.10am. Our first flight was delayed due to the weather from the previous night. They told us that the plane was not able to complete its full route to Philly and had to stay in Baltimore because of the rain the night before. We were told that the plane was supposed to arrive to Philly airport around 8am, making its departure to JFK at 8.40am. After waiting for 3 hrs, they started delaying the flight every 20 mins until finally we were able to board at 10.40am, making us miss our connecting flight to the Dominican Republic. Before leaving Philly they rebooked our connecting flight to 2pm. After getting to JFK and almost ready to board the next flight, they said that the plane had some mechanical problem and the flight was delayed 2 hrs, when finally we were about to board that plane, we were told that we were not booked for that flight even though we had seats numbers. They sent us to customer service where they wanted to rebook our flight for the following day with no accommodation, I argued and they put us on the following flight that night at 10.30pm. After boarding this flight they made us wait inside the plane for about an hour before leaving. After almost 24 hours of delays and waiting we finally got to our destination at 3.30 in the morning. Our baggage did not arrive on the same flight. Its a shame how unorganized Delta has become."

I usually fly economy but decided to spring for first class as my traveling companion had never flown in that cabin before. It was nice to check bags with no fees! Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class. The wrap and accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Drinks flowed and attendants were offered snacks and checked on customer needs.  I had heard and Delta and its regional partners have worked to improve service and food and I was not disappointed."
2255,9,9,July,2015,Economy Class,MCO , ORF , ATL      ,Couple Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"The terminal in SEA was unbelievably chaotic as it was a mix of overseas, Hawaii and cross country flights. There was very little seating and the place was cramped. Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets. I imagine it is easy to overlook the seat pockets as fast as they have to turn the plane around but I still think an extra minute or two and it could easily be taken care of."

What was interesting how the cabin was separated though not with a divider so it felt very exclusive. In addition, there was a blanket and headset for watching the back seat TV. We received other snacks as well as the other normal offerings. One thing that can be said is Delta is trying to improve its service and the fact that they still offer some type of snack with your drink is better than what you get from American and United."

We were the last ones to board and by the time we got to the entrance, my bag was automatically taken to be sent with the rest of the cargo because the flight was full and there was no space. When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag. The crew were also unprofessional and tried to argue the fact that once the bag is checked that there was nothing for them to do and that's how things are.

On arrival at MSP I realized that my connecting flight to JFK was delayed, making the JFK connection impossible. When I explained my dilemma to a very helpful Delta employee in the Delta Club room she immediately worked on getting both me and my luggage onto the MSP/LHR service. An ontime boarding took place and I was greeted with a smile by the cabin services manager. Once airborne dinner was served (a very reasonable meal) promptly allowing the maximum time for sleep. We arrived into LHR on time and I cleared immigration and customs in a little over 30 minutes from touchdown. Delta had done for me exactly what I had asked from them, a safe, pleasant, on time journey. All the staff that I encountered during this trip were friendly and responded positively to my needs.

Took off on time, good games, movies, TV shows on the large seatback screens. Flight crew stayed busy the whole time serving snacks and drinks with 2 or 3 runs at least.

No where when I purchased the ticket did it tell me I'd be charged at the airport, wouldn't you think they would have charged me upfront when I paid for the ticket? If that wasn't bad enough I was told that because of the short period if time before the aircraft was due to depart, 1 hr, if he didn't make the flight there would be an additional $50 fee to get him on the next flight. We were at the airport at 3.30am, not my fault that Delta's counters don't open until 4am.

Salt Lake City Airport was dirty and confusing, we had 55 minutes to make our connecting flight and nearly missed it because of the long time it took to change terminals.

Flight Attendant created confusion trying to rush us in our seats. They took all 4 of my family's bags and rudely told us they would arrive in SLC our final destination. A diff Attendant handed me 2 baggage labels. I started to ask why 2 instead of 4 and ignored me and rushed up the isle. Because of delay we missed our connection. The Delta staff at JFK were horrible! Very short and acted annoyed that they had to give us directions to catch the new later connection. We arrived at the new gate to more Very rude Delta staff. Our tickets said not assigned so I stood in line at the gate to find out our new seats. When I approached the Delta staff I was told to sit down she was working on assigning seats (several passengers missed the connection). I tried to request that seats together because we were traveling with children on a 5 hour flight. She firmly told me to sit down. I felt like an idiot. They put us on the very back row with seats that partially reclined. Let's just say it was a long 5hours. After arriving in SLC 3hours later at midnight, only 3 out of the 4 bags that the rushing flight attendant took from us in the aisle arrived. Went to bag help and another employee who said he could only take a report because they didn't have record that they checked 4 bags only 2 -  Delta did give us a 1888 number to call.

On the way back Delta had no record of our reservation but since we had proof they managed to squeeze us onto the plane after trying to get us to take one 2 hours later.

Our flight was marked as mechanical problems and Delta advised customers that we had to provide our own hotel room since they ""ran out of hotels due to multiple flights cancelled that day"". After being on the phone with several agents and talking to associates at the airport we were advised to find our own hotel and submit it to Delta for possible reimbursement. The next day I spoke to a supervisor and she informed me that Delta airlines does not issue reimbursements and she could only give it in a form of a travel voucher for our next flight. I then phoned their customer care team and they told me the same thing only instead they could offer me an iTunes gift card."
2274,8,28,June,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,Australia,Not Specified,Aircraft a bit old but cabin crew were friendly and extremely helpful. A pleasant trip following a long haul from Sydney. The pre-flight safety brief was hilarious and a great attention grabber. Wish more airlines were as imaginative. Had heard some differing views about this airline but we were very pleasantly surprised.
2275,1,26,June,2015,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"DCA-MSP flight went smoothly. Smooth connection at MSP. MSP-NRT flight has many pros and cons. The seat was very comforatable compared to other airlines combined with a satisfactory IFE. The food could be much much better. I had chicken teriyaki for my supper and that was acceptable, but breakfast was horrible. The appearance was bad enough, the egg looking like a wet sponge without any air pockets and the sausage was burnt. But the taste was even worse. The fruit was acceptable. To end on a good note, the arrival at NRT went very well and smoothly."
2276,1,25,June,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I made a reservation with Delta airlines in April 2015 for travel in July. I am a single father traveling with two small children (ages 6 and 10) and booked far in advance and in First class so that I could sit with my children. I was informed 24 hours ago that our seats had been changed and that I would not be seated with my children. When I called Delta to inquire (and after waiting more than 2 hours to speak to a representative) I was told there was nothing that they could do and that my children would have to sit by themselves. Despite the obvious safety concerns, there is no way that I can assist my children with beverages or bathroom breaks if needed. If you are a single parent, do not fly Delta. Not family friendly."
2277,9,22,June,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Family Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Had a pretty good experience with Delta. Had 5 persons in my party, 2 of which with lap children. We were in basic economy on the way to Tampa. The only complaint we had on the way out to Tampa was the crew weren't happy. On the flight back we upgraded our 3 seats to Comfort Plus which was much better. More leg room, better snacks and free alcohol. The flight crew was cheery and up beat making the flight easier."
2278,9,19,June,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"Left Minneapolis RT to San Jose in June. First Class RT paid ticket. On the flight out we were served a full breakfast. The food was actually not bad. Flight attendant was very attentive and quiet busy checking on all passengers. Did not disappear after the meal service. The flight back to Minneapolis was also excellent. Boarding was orderly in both directions. Lunch was a large salad. However, only one choice. It was a Salmon Salad. Quite a few of passengers turned it down, including me. I was surprised there were not at least 2 choices. Once again First class FA was great. Waiting to board in both directions, the checked baggage and the number of carry on is being abused. in both directions. People were checking bags that were huge. Not sure how they got past TSA. Gate Agents need to enforce bag sizes and the number of bags people try to drag on."
2279,1,18,June,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Solo Leisure,United States,Not Specified,"I took my second trip with Delta and I must say I was definitely not disappointed. I flew with Delta last year and felt there was no need to change to a different airline. I flew from Indy to Phoenix via Minneapolis. The crews both at the gate and during the flight were professional and respectful.  The big two thumbs I want to give is on my luggage in Phoenix. No sooner had I walked off the plane and down to the baggage claim carousel was I greeted by my bag arriving. Only thing I found average was the seat comfort, but granted I have never really cared about seat comfort."
2280,10,17,June,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Business,Japan,Not Specified,"For a short haul flight like this one (7-8 hours each way), I try and save money by not booking business class, rather ""economy comfort"" on Delta. As usual, the service is perfunctory, the food not bad in and out of Narita, the seat fairly comfortable, and the entertainment of good quality with lots of choices. No drama on either flight. My only complaint that has never been addressed properly with Delta over the years is the horrible state of the lavatories. They are always left to fester for entire flights. I have never once seen an FA go in one to clean one. Delta is not ""special"" compared to other international carriers, but it's adequate and they have treated me well in the Skymiles program so far."

Unable to check in online, then checked in at airport but without assigned seat. Result: sitting separate from my boyfriend while I am afraid to fly. At check in counter not very helpful, lady (though friendly) said she couldn't do anything and that we had to wait until boarding. At gate itself they're trying to get us to sit next to each other but difficulties since flight is fully booked. Not impressed with customer service and we were not informed by email, when booking, or at check-in that there were paid seats as an option and that the free seats were given away and that is why we were assigned no seat number. "
2283,1,6,June,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Delta will always be my first choice across the Atlantic and I have found them to be always even better than either BA or Virgin (who have themselves always provided excellent service). My latest flights were no exception. This is the second time I've flown from Heathrow to LAX in four months and both times the service has been great. Without doubt the friendliest cabin crew I have met the in-flight entertainment was good the food was okay and plentiful and the drinks and snacks kept coming. My first choice every time and whilst not the cheapest carrier it's certainly been the most reliable and pleasant to fly with.
2284,1,6,June,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,5/28/15 PVD-ATL-CAE 6/1/15 CAE-ATL-PVD. Flight was on time departing PVD. Had booked Economy+ and was lucky enough to have an empty middle seat. Got a free cocktail in Economy+. Unfortunately passengers ignore the signs that say bin space over those seats is reserved for Economy+ because when I boarded I had to use a bin 4 rows back which is annoying when deplaning. Got delayed about 25 minutes by weather before landing at ATL. Had to go straight to the gate for the next flight. Staff was very pleasant. ATL to CAE is less than 30 mins so there is no beverage service. Arrived at CAE about 50 mins before my scheduled flight from CAE to LGA. Got a text saying it was delayed 45 mins. I knew I would never make the connection to BOS. There was a flight boarding to ATL and I asked if they could get me there faster. They said they couldn't get me to BOS earlier but they could get me to PVD. They gave me a seat (and happily changed it when I asked for an aisle). No beverage service. CAE to ATL is killer at 7am! No Starbucks in Terminal C at ATL. Flight to PVD arrived 20 mins early and flight attendants were very pleasant.
2285,1,4,June,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,JFK to LAX. We were apprehensive about flying Delta but got a good price on this mid afternoon flight. Bought Delta comfort to see if this improved the experience. Flight left on time. Seats were ok food poor but attendants were friendly and aircraft wasn't in as bad a condition as we had expected. Overall an ok experience.
2286,8,1,June,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,$600 for the less than 2 hour flight 1377 (PHL-RDW) booked 2 weeks in advance was daylight robbery. The 30 minute line at the baggage drop caused entirely by staff shortage added insult to injury. But never mind the flight was delayed by over an hour anyway.
2287,9,1,June,2015,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have chosen Delta for years because of it was the best one but lately it's service has been so terrible that I will never fly with them again. Twice now I have flown out of Detroit and there have been problems that have delayed the flight to our next location (I understand that problems happen) but while we were on our flight I was very thirsty and asked the stewardess for a glass of water and she said the cart would be by shortly - the cart skipped our whole section and when I tried to stop the flight attendant again I was ignored - I didn't see the attendants for the rest of the flight. When we arrived at Atlanta to switch to our next flight we had missed our flight. The first time no one would help me - I must have talked to at least 10 people before finding someone that rudely told me to go to a certain gate and wait and that I might make it onto that flight. This time I went to the gate and they told us the plane had just left (the plane was not suppose to leave Atlanta until 12.50 I was at the gate at 12.40) and when I asked where do I go to get another flight I was ignored and they walked away. I then went to the information and was told to go to a gate that had no one at it - no one! I then went back and was rudely sent to another gate where I was told they didn't know if they had a seat available for me. After an hour I was able to get a flight home. I could not believe the rudeness that I was treated with.
2288,1,31,May,2015,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My wife and I were booked on Delta flight 7 leaving Dubai at 9.45 pm. There was a mechanical problem with the plane these things happen. We were advised to go wait in a nearby Business Class lounge and wait for an announcement which never occurred. I walked back to the gate only to then discover that the flight had been cancelled and no announcement had been made the gate agent even admitted this. The rebooking was a nightmare we finally left Dubai two days later and had to endure the same rude gate agents who were more concerned with talking on their cell phones and playing around than taking care of the customers. Most of the agents did not speak even a small amount of English they were not organized and clearly not professionals. I have flown with Delta for over 11 years this is the worst experience I have ever had.
2289,8,31,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Worst airline I have ever flown. We are frequent flyers and this was a trip from hell. We will never fly Delta again. We were traveling from LAX to Dublin with a change of planes in N.Y. We sat in the plane on the ground for 2 hours at L.A.X. because of mechanical problems. Because of this we missed our connection to Dublin so had to spend the night in N.Y. From N.Y. They flew us to Atlanta the next day. Again there was airplane problems. We waited for two hours at the airport for them to find a plane that worked. It took us two days to get to Dublin. On the way home we flew from Dublin to N.Y. again sat on ground for 2 hours and 15 minutes on the Tarmac. Once we arrived back at LAX waited another hour in baggage claim only to find that our one bag was put on another flight.
2290,9,29,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,LAX-SJO DL1388 1 May 2015. SJO-LAX DL1396 11 May 2015. We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have layflat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that layflat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight even though some of it was across the Pacific Ocean. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. Flight safety is serious business. A safety briefing by a cabin attendant reinforces that. Downplay it with a cartoon gives the impression that its all one big joke. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It comprised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40 min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class. My view is that one should avoid Delta at all costs.

No IFE on the inbound flights but because I had a tablet I just connected to their wifi (without paying) and go to Delta Studio allowing me to stream movies for free. On the return flight the B737-800 was newly refurbished and had IFE with some good choice of videos. Snacks (to be purchased) are as usual awful. Flight crew polite and professional except the on the MSP-PDX leg where two flight attendants were more preoccupied by taking breaks than serving beverage in a professional manner. No delays on all segments.

2293,1,28,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Looked forward to Delta Comfort on recent flight from DFW to Minn. Delta changed planes so there was no Delta Comfort. I was relegated to a window seat. Delta could not get their act together on reassigning seats so the boarding process was terribly slow and disorganized. I fly Delta to Minn because I have to not because I want to. I don't think American's customer service or organization is great but it's better than this. If you can use another airline.
2294,1,25,May,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Honolulu - Narita Business. A very pleasant experience. Very comfortable private seat excellent entertainment and very good food on this nearly eight hour flight. Cabin crew could have been warmer but otherwise did an excellent attentive job.

2295,3,25,May,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,France,Not Specified,DL2311 on May 2nd 2015. JFK-MIA lounge with very poor.

2296,1,20,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,5/9/15 SLC-SMF Airbus A320. My spouse let me sit in her first class seat. It was a disappointment: legroom not much better than Economy Comfort although the seat was wider and had more recline. The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any.
2297,8,20,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,LAX-JFK-KEF return Comfort + on all four segments. The Sky Priority boarding and extra legroom were a real plus but the DL Comfort + seating does not compare to BA Premium Economy. The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX. The ancient 767 on the final JFK-LAX leg was too warm had poor ventilation and the VOD lacked the live Dish TV option. Boarding for JFK-LAX was chaotic.
2298,4,20,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"We could have driven From Louisville to Portland ME quicker than Delta was able to get us there after they had a plane changed at a gate in SDF due to a ""bathroom"" issue and difficulty finding the flight crew that apparently wandered off and could not be found for a while."
2299,1,20,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,5/0/15 PHL-SLC Airbus A320. Flight similar to the ones I took on 5/4/15. Economy comfort is better than economy but not by much. Its main advantage is priority boarding which allows me to avoid the inevitable rush and scramble for overhead bin space. Rated food as 1 because I didn't buy any entertainment also as 1 because there wasn't any. I don't look forward to flying with Delta even in economy comfort.
2300,7,20,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,5/4/15 MSP-PHL MD 90. Rated food as a 1 because the inflight offerings do not appeal to me. When I've tried to purchase food items on previous flights the FAs have run out of the items I would have ordered. So I brought my own sandwich. I also brought my own beverage because FAs on a previous flight refused to sell me a bottle of wine for dinner told me to wait for the beverage cart's second round. Rated entertainment as 1 because there was none. The FAs were competent the aircraft clean and on time.

We were booked on this flight after missing connecting QF flight from MEL. I was seated in an aisle seat next to the emergency exit plenty of legroom possibly the most comfortable seat I've been on (having only flown economy). The snacks and drinks were fine the cabin crew were attentive. However it is simply wrong that you cannot use the entertainment system during take-off and landing. Overall quite average service nothing particularly bad however I still would prefer QF if I had the choice.
2304,9,12,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,On 28 April 2015 my friend and I travelled from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Atlanta Georgia for our connecting flight to Manchester England UK. Due to storms in Florida our flight was delayed by an hour. Despite the pilot's best efforts we arrived at Atlanta B24 35 mins before our flight to England was due to take off. After running as fast as we could we arrived at the check-in desk 10 mins before the Virgin plane was due to depart (the airline was aware of the Florida delay). Despite the best efforts of all the personnel on duty they were unable to get us on the plane. Nevertheless not only did the staff stay with us to locate our baggage at B24 but tried and succeeded to get us on another plane to depart that night. Staff not only located our baggage but ensured it would be put on the new flight. To the lady who got us two seats on the Delta flight to Manchester via Amsterdam and the staff member accompanied us to E30 to make sure we were checked in and on our way home.
2305,3,2,May,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Milwaukee WI to Atlanta GA - Panama City FL return.

2307,10,23,April,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,Travelled from DUB-ATL-RSW on 22nd April 2015. Very good service from any Delta employee either check in or flight crew we had contact with. My wife and myself travel from DUB 3 or 4 times a year always with Delta to enjoy the Florida sunshine. We do on occasions treat ourselves to a trip up front and to a degree we are looking forward to the trip already booked for the end of Sept when we are using some of my wife's miles to upgrade. Everybody today worked well and provided a very good service on both flights and I would have no problem at all about saying that the Delta workers represented their company very well.
2308,5,22,April,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,"We flew to Phoenix from Montreal with a Detroit connection and cannot believe what is passing for a decent airline experience in the US these days (the return on American Airlines was just as bad). The least passengers should expect from an airline is a seat that is not torn and filthy a plane that leaves on time and that arrives on one piece. Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago. Seats were small and do not get me started on the pitch. Dilapidated and depressing two other words starting with ""D"". Delta needs a makeover. I have new insight into why Air Canada is rated the best airline in North America. The bar is so very low."
2309,3,20,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Colombia,Not Specified,DL 449 BOG-JFK business class. Awful Avianca lounge in BOG crowded and rude staffed. The aircraft was a 1980- vintage B757 unbelievable! Flight left 35 minutes late with no explanations. Although skypriority boarding was smooth the welcome sparkling wine was warm. No peanuts not even a napkin. Refills were offered by the rather friendly and respectful crew. Nice two course dinner with fair wine offer. Overall a nice experience which was ruined on the return JFK-BOG leg.
2310,0,20,April,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Colombia,Not Specified,Return flight JFK-BOG business class. Awful dirty DL Skyclub at terminal 4 wherein all drinks and food have to be paid for except for mediocre house wines warm domestic beers and yes popcorn. Flight left 30 minutes late. Rude disinterested crew barely greeted the boarding passengers. Same ancient 757 with fairly comfortable lie flat seating. Were served an awful breakfast at midnight instead of dinner with no explanations. Then crew gathered in the front galley screaming and laughing bothering paying J class passengers that were trying to sleep. One of the pilots occupied seat 1A beside me without even saying hello. Unbelievable. Finally the crew forgot customs forms to entry BOG they didn't even knew they existed so we had to get them upon arrival. Luggage arrived one hour after arrival. Never again.
2311,0,20,April,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Travelled from London Heathrow to Los Angeles in early April 2015. From the time of check-in the Delta staff were nothing but extremely helpful and obliging making the process super quick and easy. The flight itself was fantastic - unlimited drinks/alcohol (I had three very generous servings of red wine) and ample food. Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige. The in-flight entertainment was also top notch - wonderfully wide selection of television shows and films. All in all a very pleasant experience - can't say the same for the subsequent LA > Vegas leg of the journey so will be sticking with Delta for intercontinental flights!
2312,1,19,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,China,Not Specified,Shanghai Pudong-Tokyo Narita on old B767-300ER return on A330-300 both on time check-in/boarding very efficient lounge at Pudong Airport run by China Eastern which is always bad nothing to eat and over-crowded. Inflight food and drinks good considering it's a 2hr regional flight crew very polite and friendly. AVOD is amazing with lots latest movies.
2313,2,14,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,First time with Delta and very pleased with the result. Seat on the 767 worked fine if slowly and the flat bed was comfortable. This was enhanced by the excellent Westin pillow and duvet. The most comfortable pillow of any airline I have flown with. Food was excellent well presented and flavourful. Cabin crew were pleasant attentive and polite. The only bad thing I can report was the IFE system. It took five or maybe six attempts to make it work and the selection of movies was extremely limited. The small screen was not of great quality either. Flight was on time.
2314,1,14,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.
2315,7,14,April,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away. It turned out the name confusion was an issue again. I will never fly Delta again if I can possibly avoid it."
2316,3,12,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,JFK-NRT-SIN And back. Sky club at JFK was nice but wish food didn't need to be paid for. First flight was largely uneventful the seats were what I expected food was nothing special and IFE was great. The lounge in NRT though needs an upgrade in terms of F&B. A lot of other airlines have more than just small bowls of whatever they're serving. (At least there were showers). NRT-SIN was normal and like the previous flight. The return was similar aside from the fact that Delta actually listened to customer feedback and pushed the departure time from 6 to 7am. Not too thrilled that the arrival into JFK is when a bunch of others come in and result in a 2 hour wait at immigration.
2317,10,12,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I arrived at the airport around 8.50 for a 10.15 flight. I was on military orders. They delayed my flight and/or switched my flight 10 times. Put me on Standby on 3 different flights. They gave no preference or concern. I called to talk to customer service and they did nothing. During my flight from Jacksonville to Atlanta they didn't even serve food or drinks because they said they ran out of time. I could have driven from Jacksonville to Norfolk faster. I was in the airport for 14 hours. That is unacceptable and the staff won't tell you if you made standby or not so you have to wait there instead of getting food or leave the area.
2318,2,12,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,JFK to LHR possibly the worst flight and service I have experienced. The cabin crew made it clear that passengers were especially economy were a real inconvenience - the customer service was awful food and beverages dumped on trays and very little interest in the passengers. There was no excuse everyone was polite to the cabin staff and if anything had kicked off it would have been as a result of their rudeness and failure to pay attention. Economy doesn't mean cheap had I been travelling alone I would have travel business but as I was with a group I stayed with them. Compared to Virgin Atlantic and BA Delta is a waste of money will always change the flight or choose another carrier in future once was too much.
2319,6,12,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Belgium,Not Specified,Flew DL from Brussels to Sacramento CA. It turned out to be a really good trip. All flights were on time and connections went smooth. Both ground and inflight staff were very professional and friendly. The special meal I ordered was fine. I would definitely recommend this airline!
2320,0,12,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew from BNA-ATL-EYW round trip for spring break. Full planes no upgrades available. Its nice to take a full size plane into Key West. All four flight segments were nice clean comfortable. Seat was tight but its coach and no flight was over 1.5 hours. Flight attendants were competent and pleasant on all legs. Loved the gate crew at Key West campy and competent. Made everyone laugh. Easiest way to Key West in my opinion. It wasn't cheap and my Frequent Flyer miles were no good for a First Class upgrade but I didn't mind a single bit.
2321,2,6,April,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,LHR-JFK 29th March 2015 - B767-400 - Boarding was slow at Heathrow but very organised we had a basic economy seat on our outbound sector and I've never seen Seats so small my partner is 6ft 6 and could not fit in the seats and although everyone is entitled to someone even had the audacity to recline their seat in front of him knowing he couldn't fit. Flight was full but the services offered were very good and efficient we were offered a complimentary meal and a snack during the flight along with beverages. Flight attendants were very nice and polite however a couple of them were miserable and rude and towards the end of flight they lost interest and almost threw the coffee at us. We were happy to get off the flight it was very uncomfortable. JFK-LHR B767-300 - Our inbound sector was much better we paid to upgrade into economy comfort with exits seats which also meant priority boarding. Seats were not the greatest but legroom was huge and better for my partner. Flight was a night flight and it was very quiet and almost empty flight attendants polite and services offered again were very good. Both aircraft each way were ageing but at least they got us to our destination. I noticed Call bells were not answered and were left for hours. In flight entertainment was good new films offered for free along with games and TV shows. I would recommend Delta but next time would definitely pay to upgrade both ways due to the seat pitch in basic economy.
2322,7,6,April,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,France,Not Specified,Economy Nice CÃ´te d'Azur to JFK 4th April 2015. Flight was about an hour delayed to leave Nice airport but Delta gave all passengers complimentary pizza and drinks as an apology for the wait (even though I had received an email about the delay several hours before). Boarding took forever as the mandatory checks have become very long and tedious (my carry on bags were opened for a second time right before I boarded the plane although this was randomized from what I understand). The plane floors and loos were quite dirty as if a thorough cleaning had not been done in a while. Very limited food choices although staff helpful with snacks. Other than above (oh and the horrendous immigration queues at JFK) everything else was great.
2323,0,28,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"DL28 Atlanta-Heathrow 16/3/15. Party of 4. Paid $99 upgrade to premium economy (drinks and seating package). We were offered 2 drinks and noticed all economy passengers were offered same FOC. There was little or no discernible difference between our seats and other seats in economy cabin. We were given the wrong food which was awful. The video equipment failed and it took almost 1 hr. to effect a reset. Hostess never did respond to call had to walk up the plane to report video and food issues. Generally a ""could not be bothered"" attitude."
2324,4,28,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew Business from BOS to AMS in late February. The newly configured Business cabin on the A330 is now my favorite on any airline or any plane. Very comfortable seat/lie flat bed and personal space. I was traveling with my husband and unlike many other configurations the two middle seats allow two passengers traveling together to actually be together. The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy. I just have one other comment and that is I wish they didn't serve a bag of spiced nuts with the first cocktail and instead served something like hot nuts or chips in a dish instead of a bag. Just a little thing but the only are a that isn't top-notch.
2325,6,26,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,BOS-LAX 738. Boarding was fairly efficient. They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10.
2326,0,25,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Flying from LaGuardia to Dallas the flight was cancelled without the airline letting us know then they had no flights for 10 hours from NYC to Dallas. Really? Not even a connection out of their home town of Atlanta. No apologies no sympathy just the typical ""welcome to New York"" chuckle. You would think the airline could have tried to help my family and me for at least 10 minutes without a sarcastic ""sorry but it could be worse!"""
2327,5,25,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Generally I like Delta airlines however they need to have the staff designing connection between small and large airports try to make those flights when the weather isn't perfect. I have had numerous bad experiences connecting between Madison WI and Detroit MI on my way to Boston. I have had to run from one end of DTW to the other end change terminals i.e. run from B to A. I am a Medallion level passenger. Delta needs to work with the Detroit Metro Airport to get connecting flights closer together.
2328,9,23,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly. I will never fly Delta again as long as they operate this way.
2329,8,20,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Never again with Delta. My wife and I experienced delays after delays yesterday March 18 at JFK after our flight to Montreal got delayed several times. It took us from 11.30 to 00.30 the next day to get from Fort Lauderdale to Montreal with a connection at JFK.
2330,10,20,March,2015,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,6th April KL6149 Schiphol to JFK. Very poor service on a transatlantic flight. Plane was loaded when staff knew there was a technical problem which resulted in us being sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. Inflight entertainment was poor (some of it was chargeable). Food provided was poor quality and tasteless. Staff were not very pleasant or personable. This was a very poor experience which I will not be repeating!
2331,10,19,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,I will never book with them again. I am currently stranded in Seattle with my 3 children who I had booked to fly as unaccompanied minors. We called to book their flights and were assured that everything was in order. After a 5 hour drive to the airport today we were told that they could not go on their flight because it was the last flight of the day out of their connecting city. Even after calling twice to confirm everything before we left! We were offered nothing more than an insincere apology. It's like they didn't even care. What pathetic customer service. Will never fly with this airline.
2332,3,17,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I was aboard a 767 from MSP to LAS (economy class) and a 757 from LAS to MSP (first class). Flight attendants were friendly and planes were clean and seemed well maintained. On time departures with easy and smooth landings and take offs.
2333,9,17,March,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,YWG-MSP-PHX. Flew YWG-MSP on a CRJ-900. I was on the 1 seat side rather than the 2 seat side so I had both a window and an aisle seat. Flight attendant was friendly and frequently came by with snacks and refills. MSP-PHX was on an A320. A little disappointing that the A320's don't have seatback TV's seat was comfortable and on par with every other airlines First Class on A320's. Flight attendant was also friendly and efficient. Food was fine (I had soup sandwich and chips). Same as the first flight she was came by frequently with snacks and refills. For some reason on the YWG-PHX route Delta's First Class is only $75 more than Economy. Delta is now my preferred airline out of Winnipeg and in my opinion is better than Westjet which I flew home.
2334,7,17,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Flew DC to Albuquerque with connection through Atlanta. Arrived in Atlanta followed display boards for departing gate. Got to the gate 90 minutes before departure confirmed gate location was correct and sat down. Sat 10' from the counter the whole time and looked out the window. Thought it was strange the plane hadn't arrived yet and they hadn't made any announcements. Gate Agents were busy issuing Delta Dollars to a bunch of passengers from last flight so the area was very busy. Turned around and happened to see on the reader board along the wall (not behind the gate) that there was a gate change. No announcement was ever made in that terminal that the gate had changed and there was no announcement with out names to go to the gate. It was moved from B28 to B3 literally as far apart as you could get from each other. By the time we got to B3 the door had closed. We found a ""red coat"" employee across the hall. She made it seem like we were idiots and there would have been announcements made. She put us on Stand By from Atlanta to Salt Lake City we had 3 shots to get on one of the flights. However it is spring break and Salt Lake is a huge destination point all flights were oversold and had 30+ people on standby for each flight. In the hustle to get from one location to the other and going to 3 different terminals we saw numerous reader boards that indicated gate changes and while sitting in those 3 different terminals we never heard one announcement for any gate change on a Delta flight. We finally had to buy tickets on Southwest so we could get home. While sitting in their terminal we heard announcements for gate changes over and over and they were paging passengers to check in at the gate. I will never fly Delta again."

2336,8,9,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby. The attitudes of the agents are generally distasteful and rude. They are treating us as if we are creating the issues and I have offered no apologies on behalf of anyone."
2337,8,9,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.
2338,2,9,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Delta recently on a finally two class plane from YWG-MSP (CRJ-900) I believe. Total trip was YWG-MSP-LAS. I despise the United ERJ-145's and similar small product that was on international routes from YWG previously. Thank you to Delta for slightly upgrading the size of your planes out to MSP. Solid 757-300 economy plus to Las Vegas. Solid crew everything was nice and smooth. The 757 had been refurbished had a great AVOD system. Flights on time crew very friendly. I cannot ask for more on this route. It seems to me Delta is making a large effort to improve their customer service and technology and overall experience. It is working wonders it is amazing how far ahead Delta is of United (my other carrier to Las Vegas through DEN). My preferred US carrier.
2339,0,4,March,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should â€œ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normalâ€practices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again. I know I am not alone as there were at least 20 people in line behind me with similar complaints.
2340,7,4,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Left at the airport in Jamaica for 7.5 hours only to be told the flight was cancelled. Now at 11pm we needed to find our luggage go through the process of finding hotel reservations along with 100 other passengers. The next direct flight home to NYC was in two days. The following morning Delta tells us that our flight leaves in 40 minutes. Now we need to pack and get to the airport fast. We flew business elite and it was so disturbing to find that the armrest was broken and that no wifi or TV. Our choice of meal was eggs or cereal? Should have gone coach. The flight was not cheap and expected more. Realizing now why Delta is not our normal choice of airlines.
2341,0,4,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Superb flight very helpful cabin crew who couldn't do enough for the passengers and were very friendly. Food good and plentiful as were the drinks. My first time flying with Delta and a very positive experience. Will be booking with them again rather than their partners Virgin who I found (unusually) a little disappointing on the flight home.
2342,1,4,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,I managed to get back home 43 hours after I left my hotel to get my flight from NY JFK to Dublin. Given no explanation left standing in several queues for hours with refreshments only given hours later. When people in the queue started giving out as nobody had given any information or updates a Delta employee got the police. I'll go via Aer Lingus in future as I know they would not treat people like that. The flight return was maybe 15 euros cheaper but what a mistake it was.
2343,8,4,March,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I will never fly Delta again. My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Atlanta to Wilmington and were made to check our carry on bags at the ramp 15 minutes later we were deplaned. We had just waited 45 minutes in the terminal for a flight crew. They board us and tell us weather stopped the flight. Don't insult our intelligence. That plane sat in my view for 4 hours and we were refused our luggage. 24 hours later no one at Delta knows where our bags are. We re-routed to OAJ customer service in Atlanta assured us they where re-routed. This was totally avoidable.
2344,8,24,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We were traveling with a 10 month old infant. We were connecting flights at St Paul Airport to Kansas City. Our flight was supposed to depart at 7.35 pm. When we got to the gate we were told the flight was delayed for 2 hours. What amazed me was that the plane was at gate. When we asked then why the delay we were told that because there was no pilot available. Now we are getting stuck with our baby girl in the airport for 2 hours when we had no baby food left. No more Delta for me!
2345,8,24,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,SJU-JFK in Economy Comfort seats. Late night flight out of SJU. Crew were fine. Economy Comfort seats had adequate legroom - glad we paid for the extra room because regular coach seats looked like torture for tall people. In flight entertainment though was terrible. Tiny overhead movie screens. I thought Delta had all seat back video screens. I would have been really annoyed had I spent the money to sit in First - those seats were not so much better than Econ Comfort and the same tiny overhead movie screens every few rows. We were handed a tiny roll with some cheese and turkey and a Milky Way with the beverage service. It was not a memorable flight and on this route JetBlue still wins every time.
2346,9,24,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew from baton Rouge to Orlando Florida via Atlanta. What a mistake! Delayed on our outbound flight to Orlando by more than 5 hours. Delayed on our I bound flight by more than 3 hours. I will never fly Delta again.
2347,1,24,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,12 hour flight TLV-JFK was excellent because of the crew. Upbeat polite couldn't do enough. Economy seating was fine and 3-3-3 configuration on 777 aircraft is very liveable for that duration. Dinner followed by as many sandwiches peanuts and pretzels as you can eat and as much as many beverages as you like all served with a smile both on request and on cabin pass throughs. Crew on this trip had seniority (I asked) and these were folks who understood the profession of customer service. Video on demand is top in class. A grade. Minus 1 point for lavatories that could have been kept a bit tidier for this long of a flight.
2348,9,18,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Japan,Not Specified,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food.
2349,8,18,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,MAN-AMS-EWR EWR-ATL-MAN. Flights all left on time. Nice FA's. Regular drink/bar service. Nice that you get a bottle of water each. Main issue was that seats were uncomfortable on the flights to NY and back from Atlanta. Flights on these were on old 25 year planes and you felt it.
2350,0,18,February,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,France,Not Specified,Flew NYC-CDG via DTW on Delta. The positive point is I was upgraded to First Class on the US journey but this isn't worth it you only can drink whatever alcohol you like. Seats were uncomfortable on the over-atlantic flight staff rather impolite and not caring at all. Arrived on time. Food was not satisfying not tasty. Entertainment is to my eyes the only interesting point on Delta. Too expensive for so low standards.
2351,5,11,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew Delta from St. Louis to Las Vegas via Minneapolis. All four legs left and arrived about on time. The planes MD-90 and 757 we're clean and comfortable. All four of my flights had wifi. The flight attendants were friendly and offered a small snack on the longer legs. The pilots made announcements as appropriate. I will fly Delta again if given the choice.
2352,2,11,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Cyprus,Not Specified,LCA-AMS-EWR and EWR-CDG-LCA. Flights on time overall good service. Food drinks and entertainment was good. On return flight was bit delayed because of snow and baggage arrived day after because of handling issues at the transit on French airport (CDG).
2353,0,11,February,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew from BOS to DFW via CVG January 23rd. Very good experience small aircraft both legs but clean I was in Economy Comfort. Flight attendants very good with excellent customer service. From CVG to DFW the flight was delayed due maintenance but it was repaired and the flight went without any issues. Arriving in Dallas just some minutes late but the baggage service was very good and the bags were out quickly. My return flight was DFW to BOS via ATL January 29th also very good planes were full both legs. I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all. I think if you are paying something extra for a seat you should go on group 1 despite that the flight was very good and the flight attendants were ok. The leg from ATL- BOS was very nice I got Economy Comfort flight attendants very professional and cool both flights departed and arrived on time.
2354,0,11,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,LGA-BNA operated by Endeavour Air on Jan 30th. Aircraft - 2 week old CRJ900. Departed 2 hours late due to the plane arriving late and the crew attempting (unsuccessfully) to fix a broken overhead bin lock. Eventually they gave up and scotch-taped the bin cover so it wouldn't open during the flight. Otherwise the flight was uneventful and fairly comfortable. Snacks and soft drinks were distributed and the FA's were attentive. My return flight from BNA got cancelled due to LGA completely shutting down due to the winter storm on Feb 2nd so I got rerouted to JFK via ATL. The 40-minute flight from BNA to ATL was uneventful and was on a completely full 23.5 y.o. A320. No food or drink service on this short flight. The ATL-JFK eventually departed 3 hours late despite most other JFK-bound domestic flight cancelled. The MD88 was completely full which was understandable given that the three previous flights to JFK were cancelled that day. Despite its age the aircraft was comfortable and the flight smooth. Upon landing in JFK we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the taxiway for a gate to become available. Bottom line: Delta got me back home albeit 8 hours late but I think that's pretty good given the circumstances.
2355,0,11,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew LAX-YVR with Delta. My first time with Delta and I was impressed. Took a 6am flight so I was at the airport at around 4am but the staff was present and was able to lift my mood even without my morning coffee. Barely a wait for security or bag check. When I got to my gate the flight crew was already there and chatting with travellers. Boarding was quick. Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between. I slept about 1.5 hrs out of the three hour flight comfortably due to the lovely headrests that adjust in multiple ways. Didn't try to recline my chair however.
2356,8,11,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Bermuda,Not Specified,Suffering from a sinus/head cold I was not anticipating my return from LAX-JFK-BDA on a red eye. My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also. All in all a very nice experience with Delta on this route especially with the new Biz Elite product between LAX and JFK-will look forward to doing it again.
2357,0,6,February,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,LAX-JFK-Zurich 24th Dec 2014. Return Jan 7th 2015. First leg of the flight came in late so we missed our connecting flight. They scheduled everyone who missed the connection on the same flight a few hours later ensuring it was busting to capacity. No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable. I will do anything to never have to fly this airline again.
2358,9,28,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Traveled home from New York to Heathrow on 18/1/15 on Delta Airlines at 7pm flight DL401 with my Husband and three friends and our complaint is that the Stewards and the Stewardesses were totally ignorant and only spoke when asking us what we wanted (food and drink). They did not interact with the passengers at all and the food was almost thrown at us this was our first flight with Delta and it will be our last.
2359,9,28,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My daughter just flew in from Miami they cancelled hundreds of flights because of the incoming storm however they chose not to cancel hers took off 1 hour 15 minutes late. Landed 2 hours 15 minutes late diverted from LaGuardia to JFK shuttle service to LaGuardia was cancelled due to weather and they literally left their customers stranded with no way to retrieve their vehicles to get home. My daughter is currently stranded. This flight should have been cancelled as were all other flights.
2360,0,26,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Philly Atlanta Sarasota and back. Out was an MD88 and MD90. Had a bad ankle. Gate agents allowed early boarding on both flights. FAs all friendly. Basic service no complaints. All flights all on time aircraft clean and plenty of room at 5' 10"". Return was MD90 and a 757. Again friendly gate agents and FAs flights all on time and overall good service. As an AE platinum card holder got free checked bag each way."
2361,0,23,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Flew SYD-DCA via JFK and return from DCA-SYD via LAX. Both flights were really good. Very friendly cabin crew and individual greetings by the captain. Food was average plane food with 3 meal services from the SYD to LAX and LAX to SYD. I would definitely fly Delta again great service good clean aircraft and also a wide range of inflight entertainment.
2362,9,23,January,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time. After this experience I would recommend Delta but would suggest that you have at least a two hour layover to prevent any problems with connecting to another flight.
2363,9,21,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I booked two round trip flights from Houston to Lagos Nigeria. The first leg of the first flight was in October 2014. On this leg I flew business class and the flight was comfortable and very pleasant. The return trips to Houston 2014 in December and to Lagos in January 2015 were a totally different story. I flew economy on these flights. The seats were terribly uncomfortable (even though I was in economy comfort) and the conditions were deplorable. By the end of the flight bathrooms were indescribable! There was all sorts of trash and food in the aisles were the passengers had apparently not taken the time to throw their refuse away. I have never had such a miserable experience.
2364,0,19,January,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication. One small irritation: some of the in-flight entertainment is pay-per-view.
2365,0,19,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Travelled from Detroit to Paris in Business Elite on Delta's Airbus returning from Rome to Atlanta on a B767. To say the least I was extremely pleased on both flights though the 767 was a little tighter in comparison to the B777 and Airbus. Service food were excellent. Delta continues to be my favorite airline.
2366,0,19,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Connecting flight was boarding when my first flight was landing. Agent at the desk said she would call through but I had to get from one end of the airport to the other. I am an older person and went as fast as I could. My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight.
2367,0,14,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"As a frequent traveler I feel I've coped pretty well with the US Airline ""nickel and dime"" mentality that's resulted in baggage fees exorbitant ticket change fees and the dwindling supply base fare economy class seats (not to mention the dwindling leg room in those seats). Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why? The only positive thing I can say about Delta is to give a kudos to the majority of attendants that are willing to put up with grouchy passengers and restrictive rules. The ones that maintain a positive attitude deserve an award."
2368,0,14,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Took the trouble to order kosher and vegetarian meals for my party of 4 only to find that the kosher meal comprised an apple and 2 bananas and the vegetarian meal was some cut melon - Delta seem to have lost all creativity when it comes to meals? To make matters worse since half the flight must have ordered the same special meal none of which was opened or eaten by any passenger the flight crew then proceeded to open each sealed package and throw out the fruit so that they could retrieve their special cheap Delta plates for later use. I personally witnessed at least 20 such meals being discarded. I regret having had to use Delta on this trip after having managed to avoid it for so many years.
2369,6,14,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,JFK-NRT-SIN. Lounge at JFK was nice the flight was long and seats were narrow. The food could be improved but then again the catering was from JFK so my expectations weren't high. Crew were fine and overall the flight was good. Wish I used the showers in the NRT lounge as I was in for a longer wait than expected. Departure was pushed back an hour and we waited another hour and a half on the ground due to traffic. The staff handled the delay well and the wait was more comfortable than expected. Landed in SIN at 3am as a result. Still good experience overall.
2370,0,14,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Horrible experience all around. The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Its pretty bad when you buy a business class ticket and you don't even get a movie on a 5.5 hour flight or a decent meal.
2371,9,14,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,"My daughter and I traveled from Winnipeg to Basel recently. Our return flight from Paris to Minneapolis was delayed and therefore we had to rush to our connecting flight. Little did we know how far apart the terminals were. Delta staff should have informed us of the distance and offered a passenger trolley. It turned out that as we arrived at our departure gate the information board said ""Boarding"" however the Delta staff person would not let us board. While we waited at least 10 minutes for a supervisor we watched the information change from ""Boarding"" to ""Closed"" and we watched our plane depart without us (along with another passenger in our circumstances). We were booked on another flight seven hours later meal vouchers were denied as we waited the seven hours we saw instances (more than one) where other passengers were allowed to board after the ""Closed"" sign was on. Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with). The FA's were wonderful on all flights - perhaps Delta would best be served if they did the training to the airport staff."
2372,8,11,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew Comfort Economy YYC-HKG return. Booked flight 6 months in advance (and got a great deal) but over the next four months our flight itinerary was changed six times. Since some of the changes impacted our flight by over an hour I called to change to other flights - agents were happy to help out and they answer their phones promptly - a pleasant change compared to the waits we usually experience with our regular airline Air Canada. Alerted by email of all but one of the changes which I noticed by accident. We had paid extra for Comfort Economy and one of the changes meant that the fee for Comfort Economy was higher - instead of notifying us that we needed to pay an extra $20 to keep our Comfort Economy seats they just put us in a regular Economy seat and kept the $130 we'd paid to begin with! Thank goodness I noticed. Flights themselves were good. The extra leg room on the long haul flight was wonderful. Wide selection of entertainment. Plenty of food/drink offered and quality not bad (daytime hot meals ok mid flight snack fine breakfast awful). Service attentive. Very cheerful on the way there and pleasant on the return flight. Connecting flights from Calgary-Seattle were on old planes but fine for a one hour flight - staff were great. I would fly Delta again.
2373,3,11,January,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,LHR-JFK return. I tend to pick Delta due to the affordability and nice service. Again I was not disappointed. Flight going out of London on time and plane not full. Got plenty of space and the food was good. Coming back to London the flight was packed and the plane was slight older however the food and service was good. I asked for a special meal that was accommodated on both flights! Happy to fly Delta again for sure!
2374,7,5,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,TPA to LAX on 12-10-14 B737 Economy Comfort another routine Delta Flight. Uncomfortable seats with slightly more legroom than economy but with minimum recline. I give Delta low ratings on account of the uncomfortable seats. Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles. Otherwise I'd like to try other airlines.
2375,9,5,January,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,PDX-AMS-PDX. I was seated in economy plus for the both legs and this is definitely more pleasurable than the basic economy. However the seat cushion still remain hard and quite uncomfortable for a 10 hours flight. Food was okay and very good entertainment system. The crew was professional and attentive on the PDX-AMS. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the return flight was borderline lazy doing the minimum and spending more time socializing on the back of the aircraft than paying attention to the passenger and especially the cleanliness of the bathrooms.
2376,10,5,January,2015,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"ATL-JNB-ATL Business Class. Atlanta flight was on time and the flight crew was very ""seasoned"". Service was good. Food was ok. Nothing special. Seats are great - I'm tall and they do the trick. VOD system is outdated and flight tracker rarely works. The return flight was about an hour late and the crew was much better. Food from JNB was much better than first flight. I would rate the second crew as outstanding. It's all about the seat and the business elite seat is among the best for such a long flight."
2377,6,5,January,2015,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew SFO-LAX on a Delta Shuttle emb-175 in first class seat 4A. The seat cushion was pretty hard but fortunately it was only a 50 minute flight. Honestly the first class seats on the emb-175 aren't great and I would never pay for them just upgrade using miles or medallion upgrade.
2378,10,5,January,2015,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner.
2379,10,5,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.
2380,9,5,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,My flight with Delta was a short 1 hour trip from LAX to SFO. It was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather but the service on the flight definitely made up for this. Drinks peanuts and pretzels were offered soon after departing LAX and a healthy snack box filled with trail mix wholegrain crackers guacamole tomatoes celery and carrots was also provided. I did not expect this to be included in the price at all on such a short flight! After flying with another airline on a domestic US trip the service on Delta definitely stood out and I would definitely fly with them again.
2381,0,5,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew Atlanta-Dubai Economy. FA were very good but the economy seats are very poor. Packed flight so no elbow or leg room. Left on time. Food and service decent.
2382,0,5,January,2015,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,PDX-AMS-PDX: Flew on economy comfort for both legs. The PDX-AMS was good with the typical Delta service which has improved over the years. Aircraft was clean and a very good IFE. For the return flight it was quite different starting with a very disorganized Delta security at the gate. The contracted agent were borderline rude and did not have a clue what they were doing. During the flight the cabin crew appeared to do a minimal job and could care less about the service and especially the state of sanitary conditions of the restrooms. Delta management should work on improving the consistency of their crew.
2383,0,31,December,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Spain,Not Specified,"We bought a round trip ticket trough Air France but the operating airline was Delta. On our outbound flight from ATL-MAD the plane was very small for a Transatlantic flight uncomfortable seats entertainment screens didn't work and the crew were not helpful with the needs of the 1 year old traveling with us well strangely enough this was our ""good flight."" On the way back we flew from Amsterdam to Atlanta the flight got delayed due to bad weather conditions because of that we lost our connecting flight that we can understand what was appalling to us was the rudeness unwillingness to help and basically bad attitude of the flight attendants who are supposedly there to assist you. We certainly will do our best to not purchase a Delta ticket again."
2384,9,29,December,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Took flight DL403 from JFK to LHR. Bag drop and check in was friendly and fast as was boarding. Seats were leather/plastic and not fabric and felt comfier than many others. Entertainment system was buggy and rebooted once as well as skipping/pausing throughout films. Food was bland but passable: chicken and rice meal with brownie bread and salad for dinner and a croissant with jam for breakfast (with orange juice). Service wasn't that friendly but also the announcements were amateurish with long pauses repeated interruptions and announcing the wrong arrival terminal before later correcting herself! I didn't know until this flight that seat changes within economy class can cost $40 each even if passengers on the same booking were placed in seats far away from each other on different rows (and the seat change was to bring them together).
2385,8,22,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,GIG-ATL on refurbed 67-300ER (economy) and can honestly say it was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken. I am 6'2 and whilst normally I can find airline seats restricting this was the worst I have experienced. I can never before remember having to sit open legged as my knees do not fit in the seat when my legs are side by side including when using budget carriers. What's more the head restraint didn't stay in position making it doubly uncomfortable for a man of my height and despite the seat being in the middle of the plane there was no recline (not that there was any room to recline into). Food was ok drinks only served once despite it being almost a 10 hour flight and the entertainment system had only old movies and the TV box sets were missing random episodes meaning it was difficult to watch anything sequentially. Not a good advert for a Delta and will certainly bare this in mind when it comes to booking again in future.
2386,10,18,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"DSM/MSP/LHR 30th November LHR/MSP/DSM 6th December 2014. On all of the flights taken I was treated well by all staff check-in and in-flight. The airplanes were clean even the two short haul flights when the turnaround was very tight. Delta cabin staff are certainly the best by a long mile as compared with the other legacy airline staff in the USA. My flights were a combination of First (internally) and Business (Trans Atlantic). The food on the Trans Atlantic flight was pretty good. My only comment regarding the whole food and beverage service was that the red wine on the LHR/MSP leg was chilled. The equipment used for my Trans Atlantic flight was a 767-400ER which was comfortable (I prefer the Business seating in the 767 as opposed to the A330) and I managed to sleep for 4 hours east bound. Delta are a good airline. People can make or break a business and now it certainly seems that the Delta people will ""make"" the business."
2387,0,18,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.
2388,9,18,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,4/30/14 JFK-LHR was a pleasant experience (evening flight). The Delta Ground Crew were fine but had some issues with regards to an additional carry on item when the Airport Customs denied our entry towards the Immigration Area. Boarded on time on a B767-400ER. Seats felt tight with limited legroom but a very comfortable back rest. Ordered our meals online when booking however my meal was not available on the flight but it was fine to wait for the general food selection. Flight entertainment was excellent getting to watch the latest movie releases of the year. Flight Crew were well accommodated on this full flight. Land safely at LHR with a delay of 50 mins. 5/14/14 Return leg LHR-JFK was a disappointment. The older B767-300 aircraft had a rusty smell. Food selections we chose online were again unavailable. Flight crew were less friendly to passengers fewer smiles yet one of the FAs stood out very well in performance. The seats were a lot of worst with thinner padding making it extremely uncomfortable to lean your back all the way. The restrooms were awful unlike the first leg which was spotless. The same goes with the cleanliness of the cabins. Overall flying with Delta would mean riding old planes and comfort is less of a priority in economy class. Delta is my top choice when flying Domestically but definitely out of the box for international and long haul travel. Next time I travel to Europe BA goes next in the list.
2389,9,10,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar. Delta is the last airline I would choose in the future.
2390,7,10,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I have been flying Delta for years (several with Diamond status). I am currently gold status. At JFK Terminal 2 in the TSA pre-check line the Delta representative made me go back and check my bag because it didn't fit in their little container which they claim is what a 22"" bag should fit in. I have been carrying-on the same roller bag for the last 8 years. Now they make me check it? I don't get it. I flew with this same bag this last Saturday the Saturday before that the Thursday before that - and carried it on every time. Terrible customer service for your most loyal business travelers."
2391,3,4,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL352 from Nashville to Detroit. Advised that the flight will be full and customers are allowed one personal item and one carry-on bag which must fit within the size check box. My carry-on was approximately 1 inch too wide due to my use of the one inch expansion zipper. So my option was to pay to have my bag checked or to use the other small duffle I had inside of my carry-on. So I basically carried on the same weight of items which now took up twice the amount of room. I understand that there has to be rules but common sense needs to come in to play at some point.
2392,9,4,December,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Nigeria,Not Specified,Flew DL from Milan to JFK after arriving on Etihad couldn't wait to see how DL matched up. I was impressed with the level of service from crew bantering with passengers smiling as they went about their duties so eager to serve. The IFE and meals were equally impressive far better than my preceding flight on Etihad flight. This is surely an improvement from the Delta I used to know perhaps the competition is bringing out a different side.
2393,1,4,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DFW-ATL-RSW DFW-ATL in Economy Comfort and ATL-RSW in Economy. Checked in online and it took less than 5 minutes to get through DFW security on a Saturday morning. I was greeted by a friendly gate agent who smiled while welcoming me onboard - what a concept for a domestic airline these days. Onboard the FAs were equally pleasant with the First Class FA even offering to hang the coat of an Economy Class passenger. Snack choice consists of peanuts pretzels or Biscoff - while this isn't much it's still more than you get on any other domestic airline. First leg arrived nearly 20 minutes early and the transit in ATL was painless though keep in mind it is a very large airport if you have a tight connection. Boarding was delayed slightly on the second leg to RSW though we pushed back only a few minutes late and arrived 5 minutes early. This flight was not full and the FAs were once again cheerful while performing the beverage service (but only pretzels this time and no Biscoffs). Captains on both legs kept us well-informed with regards to our route and progress speaking to passengers twice on both legs. Overall I couldn't ask for any more from a domestic flight in coach.
2394,0,4,December,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Disappointed traveler. Travelled to Europe via Delta and experience was not good. From terrible food to constantly moving seat assignments unless we upgraded to secure seats together. Food was not very good - service from JFK to PDX was non-existent. I would not recommend this airline and will avoid in the future.
2395,1,4,December,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Brazil,Not Specified,GRU-JFK business class JFK-SEA and LAX-ATL in first class ATL-GRU in business class. Biz class in 767-300s was great lie-flat seats. 1-2-1 configuration. First class was standard. 757 for JFK-SEA not spacious but felt roomier than in the domestic 767 from LAX-ATL (2-2-2 in first class). Food on all flights especially the international legs was good. Having priority check-in at LAX was especially welcome as I didn't have to take my bags over to the checked bag x-ray station. I didn't need the allowance of 3 checked bags up to 70 lbs for biz class to Brazil but it can be a plus. Service was good especially on the international legs. We chose Delta because it cost less than American or United for this trip. Delta's requirements for using frequent flyer miles is worse than the others but the flights were very good.
2396,9,1,December,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Four flights with Delta LHR-JFK-TPA_ATL-LHR all flights departed on time seats were comfortable and plenty of legroom including the internal flights food typical airline beef chicken or pasta ok and just about edible. Entertainment was very good with large seat back tvs good selection of movies and shows plus a number of games music selection was disappointing and more variety is needed there. Cabin crew worked hard doing numerous drink runs on the international flights beer and wine is free otherwise about $6/7 for internal flights. I like Delta and would fly them in future if their prices remain competitive.
2397,7,25,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"12/3 flight 1215 Boston to Salt Lake City. Flight 1674 Salt Lake City to Portland (Oregon). I flew Delta for the first time traveling in first it will definitely be the last. Completely inattentive flight attendants no personal service of any kind - about the only ""perks"" of first were express lines for security and a mass produced meal. In flight received no attention no offers of anything to drink - in fact felt completely ignored."
2398,6,25,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Took Delta flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. I have been flying fairly frequent for the last 10 years and this is the worst plane I have ever been on. The flight is just over four hours and the isn't any form of entertainment not even the really old TV's that 25 rows share. I purchased the gogo inflight wifi that cost me $15 for the four hours and it barley has enough speed to check email. You can definitely forget streaming anything or play any game or app that requires the internet. (I tried) The air conditioning was apparently broken as well because it is about 80+ degrees in the plane. Worst flight/plane I have ever been on. I was on more advanced planes 10 years ago. Staff came by one time to offer any drinks or refreshment.
2399,9,25,November,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew from Madison-Detroit-Paris-Pisa and return through Rome. On the way there the short flight from Madison was quick and on time. Had plenty of time in Detroit (even though its not the most exciting airport). The transatlantic flight was operated by Air France 777. Excellent as usual. Other short flight to Pisa was okay. Nothing special. On return we rode an A330 from Rome to Detroit. My brother and I had window seats and IFE systems were great. Food was as good as any other airline (though not better than Air France). In Detroit had 2 hours until connection and everything was smooth. Overall great seats food and IFE's both ways.
2400,8,25,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Flew from Huntsville AL to Atlanta and then to Hong Kong via Seattle. Then returned from Sydney via LAX. On three of the six legs of this trip Delta rearranged our (long in advance) seating. We were notified only once (the night before our morning departure). Supposedly a ""service animal"" was needed in our Economy Comfort seats on the ATL to SEA leg. I understand and accept that. But when we boarded the occupants of the seats we had originally booked the occupants were young and apparently in good heath. No sign of a service animal. I will never again purchase Economy Comfort when it doesn't seem to mean anything and is quite expensive. Also I will do everything I can to not fly Delta in the future. Finally I will tell my story again and again every time I can so that others can be fore-warned."

2402,5,25,November,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,LHR-JFK-TPA-ATL-LHR. All flights departed on time seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom especially on the internal flight food was typical airline beef or chicken and a pasta on the return leg free beer and wine on the international flights liquor payable by debit or credit card only. Entertainment was very good with seat back large screens and a good selection of movies and TV shows I felt the music selection could be improved by more choice. I have flown Delta 3 times now and find them a good airline and reasonable fares I hope to book my next flights with them.
2403,8,20,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flown this airline twice from Amsterdam to Detroit and had a terrible experience each time. My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy. But due to the fact that I have been delayed and missed my flight so many times because of Delta I will probably never fly them again.
2404,6,20,November,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL836 30 Oct. I fly Delta from HOU-ATL-HNL and return several times each month. I go out of my way to travel through ATL as opposed to DFW on AA or IAH-HNL non-stop on UA. The upgraded A330 cabins with lie flat all-aisle access seats in Business are a refreshing treat from other tired equipment on AA and UA. ATL-HNL is considered an overwater international segment with all the amenities of a transatlantic or transpacific flight. On my recent trip GOGO inflight satellite WIFI was available making a productive business trip in each direction!
2405,6,12,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"DTW-PEK and PVG-DTW Economy comfort. I must say that I fly transpacific on Delta at least 6 times per year and it has been consistently good each trip. They used tired old 747's and A330's from the old Northwest days but a completely refurbished cabin makes it feel like a new plane. Huge new seatback screens feature USB and charging ports. Delta is making an effort to upgrade economy service on transpacific flights handing out free eyeshades earplugs and greatly improved ""Billboard"" branded earbuds. Delta on Demand has hundreds of movies TV and music choices to keep you occupied on these 14 hour flights. Food service is about the same edible but nothing special. Two hot meals and a mid-flight snack consisting of a sandwich fruit and cookie. Service by veteran flight attendants at the top of the seniority list is pleasant and friendly. Overall it can't compare with the Asian airlines on service but not much to complain about."
2406,4,12,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Highly Recommended. Flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Check-in was smooth and on time departure. Courteous flight crew good food - was too much though and nice comfortable seat. On-time arrival and speedy baggage delivery. Overall outstanding experience and would like to choose Delta for future international trips.
2407,0,12,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,BDL-SJC and back via ATL. Coach between BDL and ATL both ways and First between ATL and SJC both ways. First was good unless you are in a bulkhead seat and you are over 6 feet tall. Other than that the aircraft cabin (new 739) was nice and the service was great. Coming back the flight was delayed for an hour which was awful though I slept through the delay. On the bright side I had plenty of time to connect to BDL.
2408,4,12,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew JFK-SLC 5 November 2014. Flew economy in an exit row. Ok flight but entertainment system did not operate full flight with no place to move to. Seat did not recline. 4.5 hour flight excellent FA but had to pay for food (I declined). On time take off and arrival.
2409,3,11,November,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew PDX-ATL ATL-CUN CUN-LAX then LAX-PDX. PDX-ATL was very clean on a very well maintained 737-900 attendants accommodated sister's nut allergy made sure no nuts or nut containing items were opened good IFE good wifi. ATL-CUN was disappointing. Attendants were friendly and hilarious but the MD-88 was in decrepit shape with a broken sound system broken lights broken a/c etc. CUN-LAX was a bit better of a plane but not as good of a 737 as the first flight (737-700 i believe slightly unclean and lots of TV's weren't working) and LAX-PDX on the CRJ900 was great. 2 drinks snacks as expected aircraft was very clean and had a brand new feeling.
2410,10,3,November,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Just leaving Detroit for Boston. Overhead bins are half empty. As usual attendants insist baggage be checked which adds considerable and unnecessary time to trip in Boston. Otherwise adequate trip. Seats fairly squeezed but similar to other legacy airlines. No food or entertainment options.
2411,8,3,November,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,ALB-IAH DL2033/2249. Delta would not let me choose a seat at purchase or check-in. They put me in a middle seat. Now to get out of the seat (into a window seat in the same row) I need to pay them $19. I did not get a fair chance to select a type of seat I wanted even early on in the process. So I am being forced into an uncomfortable seat and into making a payment if I want to fly with more comfort.
2412,5,31,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,My wife and I were supposed to fly out of Fort Myers on Oct 22/14 after booking our flights two months in advance. When we got to the airport 3 hours before our flight we were told our flight was cancelled and we would have to wait until 8.30 the next day before we could leave. We had to call for a ride ask to stay an additional day - all with no notice! They had all of my contact info and never called. I believe our flight wasn't full so they bumped us to the next morning to fill that flight. This is unacceptable you schedule your flights to fit into your time schedule not theirs. How are you supposed to plan a trip not knowing when they will cancel the flight for no reason do not use Delta if you need to be somewhere on time!
2413,3,31,October,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Was pleasantly surprised by Delta service in Economy class on a round trip between DTW and AMS on Oct. 10 (outbound) and Oct 17 (inbound). Cabin services both ways was attentive throughout the flight - something that some other US-based carriers fail to grasp. The Economy class food was actually tasty and abundant especially on the AMS-DTW flight. Am happy to find a US-based carrier that can hold its own in Economy class against its Euro- competitors. So would definitely recommend Delta service between DTW and AMS as a gateway between the US and Europe - even in Economy the journey is part ot the enjoyment of the overall trip.
2414,0,28,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,October 17th 2014. Traverse City Michigan (TVC) to DTW DTW-LAX LAX-SMF. TVC-DTW and LAX-SMF on Delta Connection. DTW-LAX on Delta. The FAs on the connection flights were courteous and competent. On Delta after the beverage cart had gone by I asked a passing FA for a second glass of wine. She refused to bring it told me I'd have to wait until the beverage cart returned which was over an hour later. The Economy Comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - slightly more legroom but the recline seemed the same. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my spouse and I fly to Europe or Asia I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights on a Delta partner with better seats.
2415,3,28,October,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,10-12-14 SEA-DTW-TVC. SEA-DTW on Delta DTW-TVC on Delta Connection. The blue vinyl seats on Delta were very uncomfortable had minimal legroom and recline the plastic armrests hurt my arms after an hour or so. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. Seats on Delta Connection were more comfortable. My one star rating is for the Delta seats. I didn't use the inflight entertainment system which appeared to have a good selection. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights. My spouse purchased my ticket with her frequent flyer miles. Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights. Same goes for our upcoming trips to Europe and Thailand next year.
2416,9,28,October,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"In September I flew Delta round trip Detroit - London - Detroit business elite class on planes with the lay-flat seats. Let's be honest and call them ""pods"" not seats. These plastic ""pods"" must be the most uncomfortable cramped seats ever designed for an airplane. I am only 5'1"" weigh 125# and even at that small size I felt wedged into a narrow hard space. Seats are narrow hard moulded vinyl and there is absolutely no room for anything. Couldn't even figure out where to store the provided quilt and pillow. Sit on it? Put it on the floor where it immediately becomes wedged under the seat or you have to walk on it to get out/in your seat? Fold out trays are tiny and almost useless as are the provided ""pockets"" (shallow moulded indents that won't even keep a bottle of water upright) for magazines books papers bottled water etc. Attempting to stand up or leave your seat is a major challenge. Apparently the expected protocol is to wedge yourself into the ""pod"" and not move for eight hours. Never again!"
2417,9,22,October,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Flew SYD-LAX 1 Oct and returned 13 Oct - After reading reviews online I was a bits hesitant to fly Delta but was pleasantly surprised by the airline. Found the service to be quite good food had a good variety and all meals were served hot. Also good idea about placing the snacks out for passengers to help themselves. Great choice of movies and TV shows to pass the time. Seats were a little uncomfortable but overall a good experience and would definitely fly Delta again!
2418,1,22,October,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Worst business class I have ever travelled on. The product provided on my trip from LA to San Jose is nothing close to what is represented on the Delta website nor as described in their inflight magazine. We had expectations of lie flat beds on the last leg of our long journey from Melbourne (Australia) to San Jose Costa Rica. To make matters worse this last leg with Delta was an overnight flight - so we had been travelling in excess of 24hrs before boarding Delta. What a disappointment to find we were on possibly the oldest aircraft I have flown it had a 2 person bench seat format with an individual backrest that only slightly reclined. The inflight food service was lousy (very similar to an economy meal on a domestic flight). Then to top it off there was a Dog (yes a canine) sitting / sleeping in seat 1B right next to us! There was no insert entertainment system there was a very old box TV hanging from the ceiling in the aisle which from Seat 1D I couldn't quite see very well.
2419,8,20,October,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Went from LAX to Sydney. Staff rude food awful. Only good thing was premium economy seating. The seats were hard - no frills but extra leg room. Worth the difference but would not fly Delta again.
2420,9,12,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew GSO-ATL-SLC-PHX/ LAS-DTW-GSO on a paid First Class ticket - cost only 30% more than the coach ticket and well worth it. DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat. When will the airlines fulfil their promise of dumping these dogs altogether rather than just moving them from one fleet to another? Overall though satisfaction delivered.
2421,10,12,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,JFK-FCO return Business class on Sept. 25 - Oct. 5. on A330 - this is the best business class seat by far. Seats newly configured 1-2-1 with easy aisle access. Seat controls entertainment system electronics all user friendly. Lots of entertainment options viewed on a 16-inch flat panel screen. Exceptional service and excellent meal choices.
2422,2,8,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Honolulu to LA. Lucked out with an internationally equipped aircraft for this normally cramped flight. Great lie flat seat wonderful crew decent meal and excellent entertainment. The B767 business elite made the trip a pleasure but why does the dessert come on the tray when there is plenty of time to do a separate service? This is a pet peeve of mine makes the service seem pedestrian.
2423,9,8,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Brazil,Not Specified,Have just arrived in Rio de Janeiro from Miami with a change of planes in Atlanta. From Miami to Atlanta pilot did not even announce the flight duration. From Atlanta to Rio service was certainly not bad by U.S. standards. IFE was good-managed to watch a new release in my personal screen-while alcoholic beverages were also complementary throughout the flight. Arrived on-time in Rio de Janeiro only to find-out that my luggage did not make the tight connection in Atlanta. All in all certainly an acceptable trip and would do it again.
2424,10,8,October,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Just added Delta to the airlines that I will never fly again. American was the only one with that recognition previously. Booked flight for two from Des Moines to San Francisco and return. Outgoing flight was as planned and no problems. Noticed when I checked in the day before flight that return connection from Minneapolis to DSM had gone from 1 hour to 3+ hour layover. Just tried to change departure time from SFO to Minneapolis so flight would make more sense (1 hour layover). Said they would be happy to for $235! I make sane rationale reservations with ""standard"" layovers and airline changes (or cancels) a flight doesn't inform me and after I learn about it and try to make sense of the booking again they are happy to change for additional $$$. There is something very wrong with this picture. In the future they have 2 empty seats from my wife and me."
2425,4,5,October,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Flew SYD-LAX-MNL. All flights were on time aircraft were clean staff very friendly food satisfactory lavatories well maintained and inflight entertainment stable with a great selection of choices. Safety was adhered to throughout flights. Check-in was smooth. However LAX could have more staff support during the check-in process. Baggage arrived promptly after each flight. Will fly Delta again.
2426,2,5,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 Transcon. Flight pushed back 5 mins ahead of schedule and arrived 30 mins early. The aircraft was recently refitted and the new cabin is spectacular. Felt clean modern fresh airy bright and very comfortable. The IFE was superb. Screens were huge choice was endless and picture quality great (not the standard screens you see on most aircraft). Staff were attentive and happy - came around with the drinks/snacks cart twice and I lost count how many times they came around offering water. Tea/coffee and snacks are complimentary sandwiches etc available for purchase. For a long coast to coast flight Delta far exceeded my expectations.
2427,9,1,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,South Africa,Not Specified,First class from PDX to LAX. On time good seat comfortable and plenty of space. Easy check in and boarding. Early arrival. Inflight food and beverages woeful. Very limited beverages and my choice of red wine not available. No food apart from a 1/2oz bag of crisps or peanuts. For a two-hour flight something more substantial should be available in First. And nothing else even available for purchase. Staff on board ok. Disappointing apart from the seat comfort and space. I had bought a discounted First class ticket otherwise not worth it. And no access to Delta lounge for First pax unless paid for ($50) or a regular card holder for this service.
2428,5,1,October,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flights 476 and 477. Flew first Class to Barcelona Spain on August 17 2014. Excellent service.
2429,10,22,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have had several horrible experiences with Delta. One time on my way back from a vacation from Hawaii Delta changed the connecting flight from the Las Vegas Airport to an earlier time. I was not informed until I arrived in Las Vegas only to find out that our connecting flight had already departed. The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm. Since that phone call the flight has been further delayed three-times. Delta is the worst airline I have ever flown on hands-down with extremely poor customer service.
2430,8,19,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,First time flying Delta was a terrible experience and I will never fly Delta again. Check in was really bad. My seat did not recline and my flight was LA to Sydney it means 15 hours flying in the same position. The seat was near the back of the plane where the flight attendants stay during the flight. They wouldn't close the curtains so it was always with lights on and I could hear them talking and laughing for 15 hours. It was my worst nightmare and I do not recommend Delta to anyone. There was other seats available but they wouldn't give us other seats.
2431,7,19,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Sep 1 from TYS-DTW-AMS-GVA return on Sep 15 from GVA-AMS-ATL-TYS. Just returned from traveling and used Delta and KLM. My opinion is that Delta has improved its flight services and food on transcontinental flights. Flights were on time customer service was helpful flight attendants were pleasant. The cabin service was much more adequate than in past flights. We did purchase economy comfort seats on the outgoing flight and the extra inches were appreciated. I was very pleased and will continue to use Delta.
2432,8,19,September,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,IMT-DEN-SAN-IMT. All flights were on time or early. Ground and flight attendants courteous and efficient provided timely and useful info. The seats and entertainment on the new B737 are quite good for economy. Beef sandwich for purchase was at best OK. Beverages passed a few times on a 3 hr SAN-MSP flight. In my opinion Delta provides a good consistent product these days.
2433,10,19,September,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Extremely poor service. A family of five flew to Orlando via Detroit. After a lot of hassle on my part I was able to organise the special meals for us on our flight to Detroit. It was expected that the airline would have done so the same for the return flight but this did not happen with the result we were denied this request.
2434,7,17,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.
2435,5,17,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Japan,Not Specified,NRT-HNL-NRT in business class both ways. The flight was smooth on time had decent food lie-flat seats and a very accommodating HNL-based crew of FA. No complaints whatsoever. It always amazes me at the negative comments on this review site considering my consistently good experiences with Delta. They're not the best airline in the world but they seem to try their best.
2436,1,17,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Delta 1487 on 09-04-14 from ATL to JFK. The gate agent addressed my wife and I by name as we boarded. All passengers were greeted by the F/A as they boarded. Flight left a few minutes late but arrived early. The meal consisted of a cold shrimp/chicken platter or a turkey/chicken sandwich which was very good. Service was good. My only complaint is the seating. The seat is more comfortable than Economy Comfort but Delta should add an inch of pitch in the first class cabin. I did not rate the inflight entertainment as there was none available due to the short flight. Delta 2043 first class on 09-11-14 JFK to ATL. Flight left about 30 minutes late due to mechanical problems. The captain gave detailed and many updates concerning takeoff times which was appreciated. The plane was an MD 88. Again no inflight entertainment due to the short flight. Food and beverages included snacks from a basket.
2437,1,14,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew from Omaha to Minneapolis. Minneapolis to Paris. Paris to Yaounde Cameroon. Returning flight from Yaounde was cancelled. Left the following morning. Flew to Central African Republic then to Chad. From Chad to Paris. Once a 6 hour flight turned into almost 13 hours. One meal provided.
2438,9,14,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flying on 8/25 from EWR to AMS and return on 9/5 ex AMS to EWR in Economy Comfort. Save your money not worth it. Food was horrible. Flight attendance not very polite. Service was non-existent. I asked for an after dinner drink and was told only coffee Tea or water was available. This is not what Delta advertises on Economy Comfort. Have flown many times on Lufthansa to Germany and the service is 100% better. I will stay away from Delta in the future.
2439,3,14,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I keep making the mistake of choosing Delta. I flew to Spain recently and now within the us and each time I am unable to be seated with my husband regardless of how in advance I book my tickets. When I just called to inquire about a seat assignment the representative was beyond rude and said if I could not afford the upgrade then I can wait till I get to the gate like always. I have no problem paying for an upgrade but it seems to me they purposely do that so you pay the money or pay by sitting alone! Rude and not accommodating at all.
2440,3,9,September,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,July 28 - August 2 2014. DTW to Las Vegas. My husband and I flew Delta this past July (2014) to Las Vegas. I think the staff did a wonderful job. They always offered snacks and drinks. We will definitely fly Delta again.
2441,5,9,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,SEA-LHR and AMS-SEA I had an excellent experience on these international flights with Delta. The seats were relatively spacious and comfortable and the IFE was really impressive. The food was edible and there were frequent drink services. I had a far better experience than I did with Air Canada on similar routes. I will definitely be flying with Delta on future trips to Europe.
2442,1,9,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have had a good experience with Delta so I chose to fly it again. We were flying from Philadelphia to Austin Texas. First off my flight was delayed for an hour and a half. Then we took off. My first stop was Minneapolis. We then had another stop for no reason at Detroit. We then finally got to Austin. Our flight left Philadelpiha at 6am CST and got to Austin at 7pm CST. I will never fly Delta again.
2443,7,9,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Round trip Detroit to Ft Lauderdale 8/28-9/1. Once again Delta has maintenance issues. We missed our connection lose our first class seats and get home 10 hours late. By the way do not purchase first class tickets. Delta apparently can choose to honor them or not. What a waste of money. I chose to purchase rather than upgrade and still lost my seats. The trip down here in first class offered potato chips for lunch and one drink because our flight attendant spent his time talking to another flight attendant that must have been riding for free because she didn't come out of the galley the entire flight. I guess I should just be happy they got us to our destination. Red coats are useless and maintenance is worst as our plane wasn't the only flight delayed that day due to maintenance.
2444,3,6,September,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Early August flight from SMF - MSP - YYZ (Sacramento - Minneapolis - Toronto). I flew economy comfort on an early flight from SMF to MSP The MSP to YYZ flight was on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection. The economy comfort seats had adequate legroom but almost no recline making it impossible for me to nap (the seat backs had a tilt-your- head-forward built-in headrest). The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable. Economy comfort wasn't worth the money. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food for purchase no entertainment on either flight). My wife has Delta Platinum FF status. Next month we fly to Michigan Amsterdam France and Israel. I'll let her exchange FF miles for my tickets as long as we avoid Delta and fly internationally on a code share airline such as KLM. The FAs on both flights were competent courteous and seemed to care about their passengers. I wish Delta management had the same attitude.
2445,8,6,September,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew MSP-LAX-OGG (Maui) RT and was pleased with Delta in both directions. The flights are long so not terribly comfortable but a very nice attendant suggested that I move to Economy Plus seating for the extra legroom on the outbound to Maui. The food options were tasty and fairly-priced. I appreciated that the crew wore Hawaiian- inspired outfits to put us in a festive mood. Hawaii is such an exceptional destination it deserves the extra touches! Delta is my choice for flights lately because they work hard to deserve my business.
2446,10,6,September,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew IND-DTW-JFK to connect to an Air China flight to Beijing there and PVG-DTW-IND on the way back. I was originally suppose to fly IND-JFK to connect to Air China but the flight was delayed to after 9am and I would miss the Air China flight by then. So the agent booked me through Detroit. A320 service to Detroit no food because it was only 30 minutes CRJ900 service to JFK had soda and peanuts. On the way back I was supposed to fly Air China PVG-PEK-JFK and Delta to IND. Air China got delayed and they rebooked me on PVG-DTW-IND Boeing 777 to DTW good food had many choices. No food for the DTW-IND flight as usual. Nice flight attendants good seating good entertainment funny safety video.
2447,9,6,September,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Flew JFK-MCO on Aug 28 in Economy Comfort. Aircraft ok massive delay on taxi way due to congestion. Cabin crew had no control over passengers - children were running up and down aisle yelling banging on seats including when seat belt sign was on. Crew didn't bat an eyelid even when others were out of their seats on final approach with belt light illuminated. We then flew MCO-LAX on Sep 1. Old tired aircraft with video screens fixed to ceiling. Crew inserting VHS tapes for IFE. Cabin smelt dirty carpet dirty everything. Time to retire the 757 fleet. Economy comfort seats hard and uncomfortable.
2448,7,6,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Mid August. YYZ-MSP-SMF (Toronto - Minneapolis - Sacramento). Return trip. The economy comfort seats from MSP to SMF were adequate decent legroom acceptable recline. Other than legroom they were not much different from the ones on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection from YYZ to MSP. The plastic armrests from MSP-SMF were very uncomfortable. These seats are similar to the ones on Delta international flights. I will no longer fly Delta on internationally and will try another carrier such as KLM on my next trip to Europe. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food no entertainment offered). The flight attendants were competent and courteous.
2449,0,6,September,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My wife and I recently flew first class on Delta Airlines from Seattle to San Diego on flight 5789. The aircraft was a Jet Embraer 175 a plane that I think is very practical comfortable and sensible for a domestic flight. Also there are no middle seats anywhere on this plane. The crew were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and nicely presented and served by our attentive stewardess. We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days. I have been a frequent air traveler for 55 years so I remember the good old days of travel. I contrast this flight with another first class flight on United Airlines where the service and food were horrible and the plane was filthy with a bathroom that was worse than any gas station I ever saw.
2450,9,28,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,Flew Dublin - JFK return in business elite. Didn't really get that priority feel on check in as you do with most other airlines. Lounge in Dublin ok lounge in JFK terminal 2 is awful. Food is fine and there was plenty of offerings cabin crew very nice seats very comfortable but I think Virgin Etihad and Qatar Airways business class is far better with a classier feel to it. On saying that I would fly with them again.
2451,9,26,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.
2452,10,26,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Munich - Atlanta - Kalamazoo and returning from Chicago - Atlanta - Munich. My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich. Once I touched down in Munich you can now imagine what is going to come or in fact not going to come - my luggage! Will never travel with them again."
2453,6,26,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew CDG-MSP-YYZ. First aircraft was an A330-200 which was somewhat spacious. IFE was excellent but the headphones were not that great. Seats were nice and the blanket and pillow were good. The meals were above averages and were filling. A lot of drink services too. Connection was a breeze as well. The flight after that was a CRJ-900 so it was more cramped and without IFE but the aircraft was new and spotless. Seats and service was OK for a regional flight. Wifi on board but you have to pay. All in all the two flights were pleasant and really surprised me.
2454,1,20,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,MCO-LHR via Atlanta. The internal flight up to Atlanta was surprisingly spacious seating in economy for this short flight. The transatlantic flight from Atlanta to London was on a B767 with a decent seat with good leg room. The IFE offers a good choice to occupy the time and the meal was ok and standard for economy. Delta is a no nonsense airline that does the job you pay for.
2455,1,20,August,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew MEX-DTW recently on Delta on a nice and fairly clean A319. Economy class seats had decent legroom - inflight wifi was a huge plus but no other IFE was on offer even in business class. Ham and cheese sandwich was served as a snack which surprised me as I expected no food in economy class. Flight arrived and departed on time. Staff were attentive and polite.
2456,10,18,August,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,Traveled from SYD-LAX return in Economy Comfort on Boeing 777-200. Service was ok but the seats are very hard and uncomfortable. Had a look at the Business class seats when disembarking and they felt just as hard. Really needs refurbishing.
2457,8,18,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat. Note I'm a 17 year old who can't book a hotel has nowhere to stay and needs to be on that flight the last one out that night. Thankfully the man gave me his seat and I made it home. Staff on the MSP-MCO leg were very rude. I was very unimpressed. I love Delta but it put a sour taste in my mouth.
2458,0,18,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We are a family of 6 going on vacation from San Jose California to Las Vegas with a connecting flight in Los Angeles. We missed our flight from San Jose to LA and therefore missed our connecting flight from LA to Vegas and therefore wasted a whole day (1/3 of our trip) in LAX. We missed our flight in San Jose because we did not arrive at the gate until the last 3 min of departing time. However two of our family members arrived at the gate early because they used the handicapped express lane at security point. The family members that arrived early told the gate agent that there are more people coming please wait. The agent was rude did not even page for our names and refuse to wait. By the time the rest of the family got to the gate the plane has already taken off 2min earlier which is 5 min earlier than departing time! This kind of customer service is unacceptable!
2459,7,18,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Japan,Not Specified,NRT-ATL in business elite. The aircraft is an old 747 but renovated a few years back with the lie flat seats and if you're in the upper deck very nice indeed. It's quiet two toilets for less than 20 passengers and two flight attendants. The entertainment selection is excellent. My vegetarian meal was OK nothing special but not bad. It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy. I have lived overseas for over 20 years and do not like that. I prefer kind polite service without the constant sarcasm and humor.
2460,10,13,August,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Argentina,Not Specified,I was on Delta Flight DL101 from Atlanta to Buenos Aires. The flight took of with some delay and after 2 hours in the air we returned again to Atlanta due to a problem with the plane. The problem came afterwards. We arrived at 4 am our new departure was delayed. Nobody from Delta provided a clear view of what the plan was. 12 hours after our original departure time we were still at the airport and nobody from Delta would give an answer. Last time on a Delta Flight for me.
2461,9,13,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Was scheduled afternoon of 8/11/14 to fly from Lansing MI to Minneapolis then on to DFW. About 2.5 hours before flight received automated call that flight from Lansing had been cancelled and that they would call back with a rebooking (no explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled). Automated call back had put me on a flight out the next day at around 1.30 in the afternoon getting me to Dallas about 5.30pm on 12th. I called back and managed to get rebooked on a flight on the 12th leaving Lansing to Detriot at 6am then on to DFW getting in around 9.20am the next day (an effort to try to salvage most of the work day on the 12th). Arrived to Lansing airport about 4.30am on the 12th only to be told that the 6am flight was also cancelled (again gate agent had no explanation of why the flight was cancelled). Their only option was to put me on the same afternoon flight the automated service had booked me on the previous day. My 80-something year old parents ended up driving me to Detroit to make the 7.28am connection. Complained to Delta and was given a refund of about $29 (which I haven't seen yet). This didn't even cover the cost of the fuel my parents used to get from Lansing to Detroit and back).
2462,0,13,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Economy LHR-MCO via BOS. First time in 4 years with Delta and I have to say I was impressed. The seat on the 767 out of LHR was fine (and I am a big chap) with good leg room. Flight attendants were professional if not a little unsmiling. Food service was good and drinks complimentary. The IFE was good with a good selection. The internal flight down to MCO was delayed an hour due to bad weather but we made up some time during the flight. For me Delta is a no nonsense service that ticks boxes without the wow factor.
2463,0,11,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Took a flight from Phoenix AZ to Rochester NY with a plane change in Minneapolis MN. I arrived at Minneapolis 40 minutes between flights so plenty of time then we were told that there will be a delay because of mechanical issues and had to wait for a new plane. While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate. I felt I shouldn't have to pay for something g that wasn't my fault. So I got to spend 12+ hours in the terminal. Never flying Delta again.
2464,2,11,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Delta did not notify me of flight cancellation of a direct flight from PHX to JFK airport that was to leave at 8.30 which had been changed previously from 9.30 until we had arrived at the terminal. Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off. We should have been treated more courteously and not like a herd of cattle especially as a 1st class ticket holder. We paid for more!
2465,10,11,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,India,Not Specified,"I flew from Mumbai to Detroit with a layover at Amsterdam with the total flight duration of 18.5 hours. The delta flight from Mumbai left about 1.5 hours late and the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit left 15 mins earlier leaving us stranded at Amsterdam. I was then rebooked to fly from Amsterdam to Chicago and Chicago to Detroit all the direct Detroit flights being overbooked. I had no choice but to take the flight to Detroit the flight from Chicago to Detroit was being taken care of by ""United Airlines""."
2466,8,11,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,July 25 2014 Miami - Atlanta - Asheville return August 3 2014. All flights leaving and returning on time. Clean aircraft. Pleasant flight attendants. Would fly Delta again.
2467,1,6,August,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew late July on Delta round trip from Minneapolis to Beijing and back with two layovers in Seattle (SEA to MSP was on Alaska Airlines code share not included in ratings). Booked through travel agency. Overall an enjoyable and satisfactory trip. Only item of note is that a travel companion lost her passport on the MSP to SEA flight and couldn't board the plane to Beijing in Seattle help staff at SEA were very helpful and accommodating they got her passport back and put her on the next flight to Beijing.
2468,0,6,August,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I was almost convinced to switch to Delta from US Airways and United where I have status. For 3 of 4 legs of travel the flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and professional and the service was good. This was my second flight on Delta and I was unfamiliar with their seating protocol. On August 8 Flight 5151 from LGA to CLT I asked a flight attendant if the flight was full and if I could move my seat. She did not refuse. Another flight attendant arrived and the two attendants had a less than professional conversation. She then walked up to me with a flight manage at and asked if I was passenger (name) and then said I could not sit in this seat because these seats were Premium. It was a false show. The first attendant could have asked if I'd like to upgrade to Premium or provided an honest response simply saying ""Unfortunately no."" Honesty integrity and professionalism is important."
2469,8,2,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Last year I had a flight from Dubai to Atlanta. The flight was supposed to take off at 9.30pm from Dubai. We were told that the flight was delayed 3 hours. At 12.30am they said it was still delayed by 4 more hours. At 4.30 they got everyone onboard and the flight didn't take of until 9am. Then they announced that due to some technical faults the flight was cancelled. We were asked to sit in the Airport Lounge for whole day. After 15 hours the flight took off. Overall the flight was delayed by approx 27 hours. They did not want to provide hotel accommodation the staff were very rude. No one was interested in responding to our questions.
2470,8,2,August,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Brazil,Not Specified,GRU-ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW-GRU business class. Very comfortable truly lie-flat seats in 767s for the international legs (maybe not quite as nice as the A330s of US Airways in biz class). My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class. Nothing spectacular but fine. Decent selection of movies at least in the 767s.
2471,2,31,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew DEN-JFK then CDG-MSP-DEN in Business. Was pleasantly surprised as I had not travelled DL in about 10 years. Domestic segments decent with excellent service and meals. Crew chatty and actually acted like they wanted to there. CDG-MSP with flat seats on A330. Crew were okay but still miss the class of European carriers and kindness of EK/SQ. No smiles and rather perfunctory service. Food better than AF and seat much better; Entertainment was excellent with big screen and got about 3 hours of good sleep. Only negative was appalling ground staff at JFK- rude surly and could care less. Will avoid JFK as best as I can.
2472,3,29,July,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,"One thing I find really ironic with Delta Airlines is at the beginning of the safety video they state that ""your comfort and needs are our first priority"" when it's is absolutely not the case it seems like it's the profit Delta can make. I'm not normally one to complain however after flying with Delta 3 times something needed to be said. From LA to NY return and from NY to Honolulu my family were unable to have seating together due to not booking a 'particular way' despite the fact we booked months in advance! It seems this manner of booking was only available to people who booked in USA as no information on booking allocated seats was known to us (Australian origin). Moreover we weren't the only people who encountered this issue. Another passenger was unable to be seated with their 4 and 8 year old children due to their ridiculous seating policy. Do it the right way Delta first checked in first choice. Service was bad. Rude at check in. Rude and unhelpful at the gate and even on flight they held their tradition by attendants having domestic quarrels on the plane around passengers. Food is terrible all flights are over 5 hours and only offered 2 biscuits or a small bag of pretzels unless you pay. Some entertainment also unavailable; however what was available were decent movies. Surprisingly Delta can do something right. Save your time money and hunger for an airline who cares about their passengers needs. This service isn't even worth the $10 you would pay to watch the entertainment available."
2473,10,29,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,ATL to UIO on DL 673. Flight was on an ageing 757. Paid extra for comfort class row 19. Narrow seat due to tray in arm rest. Try was broken and FA could care less. Offered no help. Food of poor quality/taste. Entertainment system from last century. Crew member makes PA announcement for anyone needing the lav to go before they pull the carts. 10 people queue up in front of my seat and wait. Crew fighting with each other over cabin responsibilities. Extended delay in FA picking up dirty trays which sat for almost one solid hour. Bad flight in every regard!
2474,3,29,July,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,JFK-YUL on Delta Connection embraer regional jet. Terminal 2 at JFK must be the worst place in the world to change planes. After entering the path to the aircraft it became worse as the metal tunnel seemed to be falling to bits loose floor and walls looked like they had been run over several times. Inflight service was dire and not at mainline airline standard - inflight entertainment consists of the safety briefing and looking out the window. Inflight snack service consists of biting your own fingernails. Although flight was early this level of service is what I expect from cheap airlines like Ryanair not those charging a premium price. Look for alternatives.
2475,7,27,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My latest flight on Delta was PHL-MSP-AMS-ARN-AMS-JFK-PHL. Why such a circuitous route to Stockholm? Delta's service: I seem to be the lucky person who gets a great flight crew (even when in Coach) good food and on time departures. The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep. Even though I am now based in USAIR/American country I still fly Delta - and know a lot of great people in all of their hubs. Only drawback is their very restrictive FF program. But day to day I would rather have a good flight experience over using my miles to upgrade.
2476,3,22,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Flight 1545 on July 18 did not have the full snack loaded for the first class passengers. So they served a ""fruit plate"" complete with pickle to go with the absent sandwich. Beware of first-class seats. The front rows do not have any place to put your feet. You pay a lot for a seat with little leg room."
2477,0,22,July,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Israel,Not Specified,Frankfurt - JFK on a B763. Very good experience: Nice seat pitch (for comparable ranks) cheerful and attentive service tasty meal and punctual take off.
2478,8,22,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight DL0056 Detroit to Heathrow: Passenger console did not work neither reading light nor audio/visual entertainment. For almost 7 hours I had nothing to do as I could not read or watch video. I asked for assistance but received no help or offer to move me to another seat.
2479,7,17,July,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Italy,Not Specified,My experience with Delta was extremely frustrating. I bought 3 tickets from Milan to Denver with stop in Atlanta. One month before departure Delta changed the itinerary in Milan-JFK-Minneapolis-Denver which was exactly what I was not looking for (2 stops rather than 1). Too late to change tickets because of high prices. From NY we took off more than 2 hours late most time spent inside a super hot aircraft on a taxiway and consequently we were not able to get the flight from Minneapolis to Denver. Rescheduled for the next day we were forced to spend the night in the airport because the customer service horrible was not able to find a room in Minneapolis. Next day we took off late again.
2480,8,15,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Switzerland,Not Specified,Flew from Amsterdam to Boston DL267 Economy Comfort service was excellent FA's chatted and were very kind. I have noted that past reviews of Delta are not very good but that seems to be inter-American and not Delta's international flights. The Comfort seats have plenty of leg-room and are very good for a 7 hour flight and as they are just behind Business Class you de-board very quickly ! Flight back DL266 was just as good so I will be telling everyone to fly Delta.
2481,6,12,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew from Atlanta to Las Vegas return for business convention. Smooth on time flight both ways excellent service and professional staff. On the flight back we sat on the tarmac for an extra 10 minutes or so. The pilot then proceeded to the runway. On the way he explained that he requested an alternate route out of Las Vegas since he wanted to avoid storm clouds and turbulent weather. I'm a nervous flyer and I was very impressed that Delta will actually do this. I'm sure it affected there on time statistics and probably cost Delta more in fuel expenses to take an alternate route. I will fly Delta from now on.
2482,0,10,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Business Elite MSP-SEA-PEK-SEA-MSP. All Sectors were excellent. International Service was fine. Food was good. All Flights were on time and had a chance to use the new immigration Kiosk's. It was a little faster. Not sure why but got a hand written note from the purser thanking me for my business. I see a definite improvement with Delta. I hope it continues.
2483,8,10,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,No more pre-boarding for passengers with children really? On a recent flight my family was instructed that Delta no longer allows passengers with small children to pre-board because there is now a pre-board fee that passengers are paying and 'got upset' that others were allowed to do so for free. This is yet another example of how Delta airlines are cutting service and delaying the overall boarding process. As a business owner and traveler I understand the desire to make money but this is going too far! Going forward I will research flights and airlines that are willing to accommodate my traveling family. My extra dollars will be well spent on an airline that values service first and foremost.
2484,5,8,July,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,SFO-ATL on June 27 apparently an equipment change where I went from exit row aisle to row 45 next to the toilet. Not bad for a platinum 2 million miler! Finally found a gate manager who helped fix the problem but none of the front line employees can make a decision.
2485,0,8,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I've flown Delta about 15-20 times. 90% of those trips have been work trips where I've not been given the option of flight provider. My current trip to Alaska from PHL leaves me without either of my bags because the Delta connecting flight out of MSP was 45 minutes delayed. Why was it delayed? Because they needed to kick 8 people off due to weight. This makes me wonder if they knew where they were flying before we got on. How can this oversight occur? Either way when I arrived in Anchorage to catch the connecting flight I had to run across the airport to make my flight with no time to spare. My bags didn't make it. Well now it's the next day and they can't confirm when my bags will arrive.
2486,2,8,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My flight was delayed not for any weather or mechanical issue but because the captain of our plane decide not to show up to fly us. It has been almost double the flight time itself waiting in the terminal. This is completely unacceptable and I am disappointed with Delta who have always been a dependable airline. The remainder of staff handled it very well but I lost a lot of faith in Delta Airlines today.
2487,8,8,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew DL #231 from Amsterdam to Boston on July 6 and I have to say that it was a great flight. On time departure early arrival. Very tasty meal (Thai chicken) perfectly adequate amount of food. Nice snacks first an ice cream then a sandwich. I really appreciate the large bottle of water everyone gets after the meal service. Inflight service was very efficient though I think the flight attendants could have smiled a bit more. Seat size and pitch were comfortable and I'm not a small person. Inflight entertainment was outstanding - a huge choice of movies both new releases and older classics - that I really didn't want the flight to end. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased but I found this Economy Class experience to be very good.
2488,1,6,July,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight 718. This flight was booked almost one year ago. All 15 family members had seats together. Now we are leaving in a few days and guess what? Three members of our family have had their seats changed. When asked to give us back our original seats the representative supervisor stated they could not accommodate our request. They stated they have the right to change any seat. Well why can't they do the right thing and accommodate their customer and give us back our original seats and move the passengers to our new unwanted seats.
2489,3,6,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Colombia,Not Specified,Flew BOG-JFK-BOG. Check in at both ends flawless both flights left on time and arrived before schedule which I think is a great achievement. Service was good breakfast on the BOG-JFK very poor meal on the JFK-BOG was much better. Seats were uncomfortable but we had a great price for our tickets.
2490,8,6,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Daughter took a flight from RDU-LAX. Flight attendant asked her to move her seat to accommodate a family who wanted to sit together then gave her a seat that didn't recline. It was unfortunate because a) by the time she realized she'd been duped the flight was taking off - and b) she just started flying and didn't know her rights as a passenger. My daughter did the airline a huge favor and got duped. It's a shame since my husband is an elite member who has been raving about Delta's supposed great service.
2491,1,6,July,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My experience started in Chicago on a flight bound for Phoenix via Minneapolis and a weather delay in Minneapolis. The experience quickly went from bad to abysmal after being delayed in Chicago. The flight crew could not help anyone with connections in Minneapolis. Although it was still afternoon the 800 number people were unable to come up with any alternate route. After nearly 4 hours of delay which included all the passengers deplaning we were loaded onto the plane after the gate next to us with a later flight going Minneapolis loaded. My flight to Phoenix which had also been delayed due to weather left 30 minutes before I got there and had our flight gone first as it should have I probably would have made my connection. But the Delta personal were unable or unwilling to deal with passenger issues like this. Instead I bunked down in the Minneapolis airport overnight. Meals were not provided even though all the restaurants in the airport were closed or closing when we arrived. The next day after 27.5 hours of travel I arrived in Phoenix but one of my bags did not. So while I understand that weather happens this airline has an appalling lack of kindness consideration or concern about getting people and their luggage to their destination.
2492,8,6,July,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I bought a First Class ticket on Delta from Detroit to Newark. I'm on my third day of attempting to get there. There were endless delays and finally cancellation of the flights the first two days. I was on standby for two morning flights which took off. Delta was upgrading passengers on both flights and left me in the lurch. Passengers were getting information about further delays before the Delta agents were. Delta wasn't responsible for the cancellation of the flights but they didn't do anything to get me to my destination in a timely fashion. The ticket I got for today's flight is in coach which is OK with me as long as I get to my destination. Later I got what Delta called a ""complementary upgrade"" - and I'm thinking complementary nothing I paid for a first class ticket. The only thing Delta is excellent at is the phrase everyone at Delta seems to have been trained to use (hence insincere): We apologize for the inconvenience."
2493,3,30,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Traveled many times with Delta and so far one airport layover stay due to delays which was fine at first until this time around. Had to stay overnight in Atlanta. Customer service is horrible. Flight times change a lot. One time I had to change an existing flight but the flight that I changed to got canceled. I do not understand why I couldn't get a reimbursement for the change fee when the flight that I wanted doesn't even exist anymore. Now that I know better I'd rather pay for a more reliable airline than stick with cheaper fares for essentially a game of chance. Will avoid this airline in the future.
2494,0,30,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew Delta first class from Atlanta to San Francisco quite possibly the worst flight crew ever more interested in talking to each other than helping passengers one flight crew tried to give my blazer to 2 separate passengers before it got to me unacceptable when you pay to fly first. Cramped seating did not help matters either. A very unpleasant flight.
2495,8,30,June,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Delta is extremely frustrating to deal with! We took a family vacation to Alaska. There were 8 of us and we had two stops each way. I reserved seats when I booked the flights. When I checked in online for every flight for all 8 of us I found that all of the seats had been changed for every flight! We were on a family vacation and I picked seats for a reason. The answer I got every time I called was that they switch planes a lot and the seats don't match. I can't imagine that all of the planes were changed! I hope that I never have to fly Delta again! They need to take lessons from Alaska and Southwest!
2496,8,30,June,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,Marked difference in quality and service between transatlantic and domestic flights travelled Dublin to PDX and back via ATL and both transatlantic legs progressed well with excellent service and no delays while both internal flights were delayed onboard service was spotty at best and boarding was sheer pandemonium. I have never appreciated Ryanair more than after my first experience trying to board a domestic flight in the US.
2497,1,25,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Delta 2366 JFK to MSP. Delayed for broken plane - we were in line to take off when they decided a broken panel light warranted fixing. We had no gate to return to at JFK so we went to the maintenance lot and were bussed back to the terminal. Had to wait for a new plane (another hour). Re-boarding pandemonium. Most frustrating was waiting another hour on the tarmac before taxi-ing await from gate for catering. this was around 11.30am. We got nothing to eat drink except one bottle of water. Arrived MSP around 12.30am. Pretty awful. Stewardesses standing around on their cell phone. Skip Delta if you have the chance.
2498,1,25,June,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flights in purchased domestic first class with changeover in Minneapolis. Lots of weather delays and was kept well informed and phone conversations with customer service were pleasant. The first three legs of the journey were nothing special. Notably the quality of the product purchased was only that of a larger seat. Inflight service was casual at best and I would not call it friendly. We were tolerated and it kind of felt like we were an inconvenience. The last flight however had a flight attendant who was service oriented and actually took care of the customer properly and a meal was served. To me this tells me that there is a quality issue at Delta. The inflight service product is not consistent.
2499,2,25,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Singapore,Not Specified,The CRJ 700 service from Halifax to La Guardia in New York is a quick 90 min hop. The economy seats are cramped but they are on all the Canadair regional jets in economy class. I got my drink. I got my pretzels. And other than that the flight was completely uneventful. This is when you realise flying has become a complete commodity. Now how could we change that?

Apart from the meals - some Thai passengers cannot eat beef so the flight crews tried to ask other passengers who could eat beef and changed the meals around. We feel disappointed with their food services.
2503,2,18,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight 2463 leaving West Palm Beach (PBI) at 2.42pm on June 15 arriving at New York LaGuardia (LGA) at 5.30pm. I was slated to take flight 3997 from LaGuardia to Pittsburgh (PIT) leaving at 6.59pm arriving in Pittsburgh at 8.35pm. Every time I fly Delta I end up getting stuck in whatever airport my layover is for 12+ hours due to cancellations or delays. There is no attempt to accommodate me the customer with a hotel for the night a partial refund or even a blanket or pillow for my extended stay in the airport.
2504,1,17,June,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Delta Website froze 4 times trying to set up flight to three different locations. Had to call and set up over the phone only to find out at the curb our flights were changed with no coumarin to us. My pregnant wife and I sat for over an hour (on the curb) for them to correct the error. We flew to our next location to find the same issue with boarding. We sat outside the line for a half hour while they tried to correct before the plane flew off. I spoke to Delta and they said because of the economy they are having issues. This does not explain why they couldn't send us an e-mail showing our flights changed with new boarding passes. The worst flying experience ever. They could care less about you even if you need special attention. Check baggage fees - Delta packs the plane and charges outrageous prices for additional bags.
2505,10,16,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ecuador,Not Specified,"Round-trip flight from Quito Ecuador to Birmingham Alabama with one stop in Atlanta. The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta. The delta gate agents went through 3 security procedures before we even lined up to go to the plane. I think it was the airport's rules. I flew a Delta 757-200 to Atlanta on a red-eye flight. We took off around 11.40 pm and we started flying over the Pacific Ocean. There was no personal entertainment on this type of aircraft so we were forced to watch a movie. They started serving ""breakfast"" around 1.20 am. ""Breakfast"" was a cold turkey and mayonnaise sandwich fruit and a brownie. They took they tray away and we did not eat anything else. Around 5.00 am we started our descent into Atlanta. The landing was smooth and we soon de-boarded and headed through immigration to board our next 56 min flight to Birmingham. Atlanta airport is very confusing as to where restaurants and lounges are. We boarded our MD88 to Birmingham. Since it was an hour flight they should have served us something but the didn't. We landed in Birmingham smoothly."
2506,10,16,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Narita - Bangkok June 13 Business Elite 747. Slight delay due to hold for other delayed inbound flights but all in all an excellent flight. Chief Purser was an experienced friendly (old school) gentleman who worked hard to insure good service. Seat was a comfortable lie flat pod offering more privacy than the first class American 777 I had just connected from. Decent food with even a light second offering before landing. Excellent entertainment options offered. I would certainly do this again.
2507,10,16,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I just returned from a round-trip First/Business Elite FLL-ATL-MUC-ATL-FLL trip. I really must say that all the flights were great. Every flight was on-time the flight crews were exceptionally good the in-flight entertainment was good but could be improved the meals were good and tasty. I only wish Delta would update its meal service and add some new items. Going over to MUC the man behind me even commented to the flight attendant ""Is it the usual?"" It is always steak chicken breast pasta (no meat or fish - just pasta) and a cold plate. I've written to DL about adding fish lamb duck etc. to the rotation. (They actually had lamb on the MUC-ATL flight!) Even flight attendants say that every time they have ""fish"" it is the most ordered by passengers. I guess Michelle Bernstein has run out of ideas. That is my only suggestion to improve things in Business Elite: Get more imaginative on the meal offerings! It really isn't that difficult."
2508,5,13,June,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flight from NY La Guardia to Cleveland OH at 01.15am email said flight would be delayed by 2 hours. Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation. Advice don't travel with them if you can avoid them.
2509,0,13,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Originally I had a 2 hour layover. Delta changed our flights to a 4 hour layover. The plane now has been delayed another 20 minutes so my family of 6 and I are at the airport right now for a 4.5 hour layover. This is not acceptable Delta should do something about this. Fly with an airline that cares. It's surely not Delta!
2510,0,12,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.
2511,10,12,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely. Not sure if this is a sign of better things to come from Delta or by the fact that the route is brand new for them but it was a great flight."
2512,1,10,June,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I was a bit stubborn about flying Delta for the first time since I'm a fan of Frontier and I don't fly very often about once every three to four years. I took flight 1531 from MSP to BWI and I was very impressed. We left on time and the crew was friendly. After this experience I am very eager to fly Delta again.
2513,8,9,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,JFK-LHR. Had a great on time flight out of JFK with Delta. I found the service friendly and food was great. Constantly coming through the cabin with refreshments certainly not dehydrated at the end of the flight. Only criticism was when we were coming in to land into London the cabin crew did not ask passengers to raise their closed window blinds which made me feel a little unsafe sitting in the middle seats as I couldn't see what was going on outside during landing. The flight attendant told me after it's not US policy to raise the window blinds Delta why not just make it part of your safety policy. Would fly them again.
2514,0,8,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My wife and I fly frequently and over the last couple of years have found ourselves on Delta a couple of times. Each of the prior trips found delays once missing a connecting flight due directly to the incompetence of Delta personnel. I wrote this off I. The past but today is the final straw. We flew from San Antonio to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Milan for a long awaited vacation. As we were boarding the 767 in Atlanta I noticed the port engine nacelle was open. Once we were buckled in the captain announced that maintenance was waiting on a part and it would take up to an hour to depart. An hour goes by and they have the part but they can't get it installed. Another hour goes by. They're still trying to fix it. More excuses more delays. Never again Delta this was strike three!
2515,0,8,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL 1134 PBI-ATL. Great ground experience. Inbound flight late prior to equipment arrival gate agents asked for volunteers to check baggage at no charge to destination to speed up boarding and ease overheads. Turn around was 25 minutes gate arrival-departure. Plane was clean crew greeted boarding passengers with genuine smiles. They assisted loading overheads with no attitude. In flight they chatted with passengers. Crew even made the cart in aisle/trip to lav a pleasant game of I move/you move. I was in a time warp. Flying was fun. Three more flights on Delta that week were routine but what an experience this one flight was.
2516,0,5,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Our flight from Fairbanks to Minneapolis was a great flight with great service. On our return flights the service was great. However the flight was very hot. Multiple passengers complained and nothing was done on 2 separate flights. Given a choice I will not fly Delta again I didn't appreciate the two four hour sauna flights. I was dressed in sandals shorts T shirt.
2517,1,4,June,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,On May 22 after a 6-hour delay 5 alerts and us waiting with hope at the terminal flight 5030 to Atlanta was canceled. And as per airport security and Delta counter the flight was canceled due to radar failure. This cancellation caused us to miss our connecting flight to Lima Peru. On same day Delta re-booked flight to Atlanta departing from another airport and for a later time. To get to this airport cost us $175.00. However once at the airport we begged to Delta to get us on a flight to Lima Peru instead Delta personnel there and over the phone made a mockery of our request by pretending to help us when in reality they were just wasting our time. In the meantime our newly re-booked flight was delayed for approximate 3 hrs and we arrived to Atlanta at midnight. Next day on 05/23 we finally traveled to Lima Peru but it was too late. We will never consider Delta for future travel.
2518,2,2,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Considering how Delta Airlines was an American Air carrier I initially wasn't expecting much and imagined that service would be mediocre sort of like Air Canada but to my surprise my Delta experience was great! Staff were polite the flights were punctual with my returning flight from MSP-YVR being about 15 minutes late due to a computer that needed replacement. Other than the fact that they should really replace/refurbish those A319s my flight was very pleasant.
2519,3,1,June,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Travelled MSP-LHR AMS-MSP in May 2014. Flights were on time. Flight attendants responsive enough and food was okay. Economy comfort seats provide decent legroom. I travel with Delta quite a bit and rarely have problems. They get you to your destination reliably for a decent price.
2520,1,28,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 in Business on May 17 angled seats with ample leg room excellent service then onward to HNL on a 757-300 in First: seats comparable to Premium Economy as far as the leg room goes poor recline the service was excellent though large screen IFE good food and drinks. May 25 HNL-LAX on an aged 767-200 in First same poor seat recline but good food and service old-style IFE. May 26 LAX-NYC on a 767-300ER Business Elite outstanding newly refurbished cabin flat bed seats outstanding food and service. The only complaint - never - ending turbulence but that was not airline's fault of course. To sum up Delta's First Class is not worth the money I will stick to premium economy instead in the future and the Business Elite is simply outstanding for a Domestic flight.
2521,5,27,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Third long haul flight with Delta LHR-ATL-TPA-ATL-LHR all flights on time first transatlantic flight they run out of food selections so only had pasta left which looked rather unappetising. Good selection of movies and games on the long haul flights seats were comfortable with good legroom. My only gripe is Atlanta airport why do you have to queue to go through security after getting off an international flight to connect with your next plane not Deltas fault but never had to do this before.
2522,4,25,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,LHR-JFK (Virgin) then JFK-DTW with Delta Connection (Returned on the same route and carriers 10 days later. Held up at JFK both ways for 12 hours due to weather not Delta's fault but our return connection to LHR was rebooked without our knowledge due to our late departure from DTW. This resulted in a rush to try and make the connection only to be told we were off the flight and rebooked for the following morning. Delta then did not issue us with the correct tickets resulting in a 4am nailbiter with Virgin check in as they tried to figure our what Delta had done. I am trying to plan my next trip to DTW to avoid Delta connections due to this.
2523,6,23,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Travelled to London with my mom JFK-LHR via a Boeing 767-400ER on DL 403 which was an evening flight. Everything went very pleasant from food service to inflight entertainment seat comfort and cabin crew as well as cabin cleanliness. My complain would be our return flight which was rather a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The Cabin was not clean and very narrow bathrooms have some odor and seats were comfortable even for a seven hour flight. Everything else went ok the crew looked exhausted and smiled less they were friendly and very caring. Also to mention food portions are quite small and selections must be thought carefully. If it was not for their 767-300 plane everything went very well. I prefer better other airlines notably American British Airways and Virgin Atlantic as a better option for economy especially with AA's B777-200ER which was their major upgrade.
2524,8,19,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Very disappointed with Delta Airlines. I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time. Pleased with the flight crew and flight attendants kudos to them for positive attitudes. However I don't think I will be flying with delta anytime soon."
2525,9,19,May,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Boy are we never going to fly Delta ever again. Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta  they warned us before we booked with them. I heard many people at the various airports we were at saying they will never fly Delta again and I agree."
2526,4,18,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,YUL-JFK-NRT-HKG. It was my first time flying Delta. I usually fly Japan Airlines or any other Asian airlines because of all the bad experiences I had with US based Airlines. From the check in agent I was greeted with a big smile. The planes were clean flight attendants full of energy and smile. To my surprise the captain apologize for the slight delay we had from JFK to Narita. That is something you hear only on Asian Airlines. The seats were comfortable for economy and the food was great!
2527,8,17,May,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Worst experience ever! Cancelled our connecting flight out of JFK leaving us stranded at their hell hole of a terminal for 20 hours and telling us that the next available flight was almost 3 days later. Employees spent their time sleeping chatting with one another or doodling on notepads. Bathrooms were disgusting. Every employee gave us different and conflicting information or showed no interest in helping us at all. Lost our bag and then told us that they wouldn't ship it to us we had to drive back to our final airport destination and pick it up. I will never fly with Delta ever again.
2528,7,17,May,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Return leg of a paid first class ticket LAS-ATL-GSO. Seemed like circumstances were lining up to give my wife and I a major headache - Bad weather on the East Coast late (mechanical not weather) departure from LAS tight connection in ATL and no seats ex LAS going anywhere East. Helpful agent and supervisor booked hotel in ATL in case we misconnected but we didn't need to have worried a fine tailwind got us to ATL in time for our connection. Newer planes on these 2 legs; the aircraft on the LAS-ATL leg even had a rudimentary IFE system. However my joy was short lived as my headphone jack didn't work and I was denied the opportunity to watch reruns of a few TV programs. Food was fair (basically the same as the outbound journey) seat comfortable service attentive ground staff throughout helpful and efficient. I'll stick with Delta through this purple patch they are enjoying.
2529,0,17,May,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"All flights delayed some due to weather others to ""no staff for flight crew"". Missed all connection flights. Help desk staff extremely rude and condescending especially in JFK. Will never ever fly this airline again. Info given by crew 10 min before landing late regarding new gate and terminal incorrect."
2530,0,16,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I just tried Delta's ""Business Elite"" from JFK to BOG on a 737-700 and what a ripoff! These ""premium"" seats offer a pitch of just 37 inches (that's less than JetBlue's premium economy); they also recline quite a bit and the result is a wedge experience which made for one of the most uncomfortable flights I can remember. I couldn't even open my computer until my neighbor decided to join his wife in much more comfortable bulkhead coach. Soft service was fine and dinner actually surprisingly good accompanied by a decent German Riesling. But seating comfort is still paramount and this was unacceptable."
2531,9,16,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,The gate experience is good with staff pointing the way. This is especially good at Paris DeGaulle where there are endless gates and lines and confusion. Once on board the experience lessens as the attendants seemingly are frequently tired and occasionally indifferent. I have never been hot (not warm but hot as in a cabin temp of the high 70's) on an overseas flight. A request to a attendant brought the equivalent of a sleepy shrug. The food is edible and the presentation tries to be quality but it falls flat with the quality of the food and the occasional rush to serve and clear. I hate the business class pods - ok for the sleeper or someone doing work but impossible to talk or interact at all with a companion. Baggage handling is excellent for sky priority. Delta clubs vary from seedy (JFK) to nice. Nothing as nice as the Air France clubs at Paris CDG.
2532,7,16,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Paid for 1st class GSO-ATL-LAS. Delta continues to do a good job in their attempt to be a cut above the other Legacy airlines? Flights were on time check in and boarding easy food good. Service prompt and efficient if not jaunty. The flaw in the program in my view is the age and features of the equipment. DL's policy is to fly them until they run out of hours and our sky veterans had amassed 51 years between them! No IFE on either flight an ugly and not overly comfortable first class seat and 25 year old bathrooms - my ongoing pet peeve with DL.
2533,9,12,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,I flew from YYZ to Detroit to Seoul I was sceptical at first flying Delta because of all the negative reviews. I am very pleased with the whole experience. Enough leg room great entertainment system and great food. I love the snack bags in the middle of the night and bottles of water. Little details really makes a huge difference the ear plug and eye cover warm wipes and cold wipes after boarding and when you wake up. Even the washroom is roomy. Flight attendants are efficient. I will definitely try to fly Delta whenever I can.
2534,0,8,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flew PDX to AMS. Flight departed slightly late but actually arrived early. At check-in I enquired as to whether I could pay to upgrade myself to business class but they said they don't have such a program for last minute upgrades which was rather odd as other airlines regularly do it for a fee. Having said that in many ways I was glad I didn't as my normal economy seat was extremely comfy with loads of personal space. Delta has the best inflight entertainment system I have used with a massive selection of entertainment. Having said that they really need to do something about their meals as they were awful and almost as bad as Air Canada. I didn't eat my main course as it smelt awful food but was supposed to be beef stroganoff. The food was the only thing to let Delta down as their cabin crew were friendly and efficient making sure we had regular supplies of water to keep us hydrated. Id definitely fly Delta again but would order a special meal to see if said meal would be better.
2535,0,6,May,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flying to Detroit From Tampa on a 737-800. Service on the plane: it was a good experience. Flight Attendants were polite and cared about me and other passengers (unlike United and BA). Food was only pretzels and cookies and a drink of choice (it was only a 2hr flight). Seats were comfortable. Service in the airport-Good service no long lines and friendly airport crew! I enjoyed Delta and will fly them again!
2536,4,5,May,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"DCA-ATL-DCA MD-90; Economy. ""We love to fly and it shows"" used to be Delta's slogan. Standards have slipped a lot since then. DCA counter bag drop-off was prompt after online check-in and the outbound flight was on time. It is amazing how many seats they have crammed into this aircraft recently to make money from Economy Comfort seats. The seat itself is reasonably comfortable for about two hours but the reduced legroom is awful. I am average height so I feel for taller people. Both planes were very clean and appeared well-maintained for 18+ year-old aircraft. A drink and mini pretzles were served on both flights. ATL bag drop-off after online check-in was quite quick. The inbound flight was delayed by 75 minutes but they made-up 25 minutes of that lost time. Flight attendants outbound were friendlier than those inbound. Overall this type of service will be acceptable for two to three hour flight segments and I will use Delta again."
2537,9,4,May,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flew MAN-ATL-HNL and LIH-LAX-ATL-MAN in Business Elite/First. Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early. Refreshments on the two First segments were acceptable and excellent on Business Elite. The staff on all flights were very attentive.
2538,10,4,May,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.
2539,10,4,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers.
2540,0,4,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We flew from Atlanta to Portland the check in process was chaotic and disorganized. We had checked in online but had not printed our boarding passes. One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful. On a positive note our plane landed on time and our luggage was there too.
2541,10,3,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flight DL0187 Date: Apr 25 2014. More expensive than other airlines. Lunch was served at 10am GMT 2 hours after departure! They had a lot of time to serve it later as we still had more than 5 hours ahead (going to Boston MA USA). You had to pay for entertainment. Many empty seats in first row but you cannot take them without paying extra! Attendant was chatting too much and very loudly and I couldn't sleep. Many broken seats won't come back to straight vertical position. They didn't have any diet or light soda but Fresca.
2542,0,3,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Switzerland,Not Specified,Flight 67 to Atlanta connecting to flight 1384 to Orlando on April 28. My mother returned home from Zurich to Orlando after visiting us in Europe. Unfortunately while here she spent time in the hospital. Various Delta employees with whom we were in contact were extremely helpful in rebooking flights and assisting her before during and after her flights including wheelchair support. She enjoyed the flight (in economy comfort) the service the food etc. As a family we have flown Delta during many years and continue to be impressed with the airline more so recently with the many improvements they have and are implementing. We will happy continue to recommend Delta airlines.
2543,0,3,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Just returned from: IND to SJU via ATL. First class on IND-ATL segments (MD 90) and so-called Business Elite on ATL-SJU segments (737-800). On all segments aircraft interiors were clean and well maintained and cabin attendants were good. Boarding on all flights was total chaos and food on the ATL-SJU segments was inedible. No food on other segments. Seats not what one would call comfortable or roomy. Not worth the price paid.
2544,9,3,May,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each).
2545,9,1,May,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,The food was disgusting and the fact that I was travelling from the UK to the USA and there was no entertainment was horrendous. My kids had to look at the front of a seat for 8 hrs and my daughter had to sit on my lap but she could not sit properly because there was no space. When we got given food it kept going everywhere because we were so squashed. The loos were dirty and small. The staff were no good they didn't help out. I wouldn't recommend them.
2546,7,30,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew Atlanta to Seattle. It is a 5 hour flight. If you want to eat you have to buy your meal however they do not have enough sandwiches so when the cart got to the end of the plane there was nothing left. If you want to watch a movie you have to pay $6.00. It costs $30.00 to check each bag. Just be aware that the price you pay for your ticket is just to get you from a to b just like greyhound.
2547,9,29,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew from LAX-ATL on B777-200 then ATL-CMH on A319. Both legs were great and crew very attentive. First class seat on the B777 was a comfortable seat if somewhat difficult to settle into at first. The A319 was uncomfortable and took a while to find that special spot to get comfortable. All considered the service I got for what I paid was excellent. Bags were first off the carousel and waiting when I got there which I liked a lot. Only issue was the miserable check in lady in LAX. DL also need to re think their lounge policy for First class passengers.
2548,2,28,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,MAN-Atlanta Atlanta-Memphis Memphis-Las Vegas Las Vegas-Salt Lake City Salt Lake City-Memphis Memphis- Detroit Detroit-Amsterdam April 2014. All of our America trip was with Delta and everyone was excellent in every way. From check in to boarding to seat leg room were superb. The pilot and cabin crew were so friendly the captain thanked everyone on each flight personally standing at the entrance with the cabin crew. 7 out of our 8 holiday flights were with delta and we had no problems with any one was with KLM see that review.
2549,7,28,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,The review is for Delta which was our return flight home from Pittsburgh. We were to leave on Flight DL 5217 on 20 April. Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter. Because we booked with Expedia they said that they Delta was not to blame (they blamed United). Worst case of passing the buck ever! (Only bright spot were the front line staff - like the desk agents who remained 3 hours extra to rebook all the passengers).
2550,2,27,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,Travelled Dublin to Salt Lake return trip. I normally travel BA which is good but in comparison Delta is a horrible travel experience. The flight attendants are fine but the aircraft used on all four segments were very old and there was a 'domestic' feel to flight that you just don't get with BA which in comparison has newer and cleaner and more spacious aircraft. Perhaps the biggest issue was that Delta typically fly 757 aircraft compared to BA's use of 747 or A380. It just felt far too cramped for long haul. The biggest insult was having paid > $2000 for a return flight to being given a 'beaker' of 100% plonk despite having asked for 'red wine'. I really wanted a glass of wine but if there was a plant nearby I would have dumped it there it was absolutely foul - I'm not a wine snob and would drink anything reasonable but this drink poured from a large container was sickening. I'd fly Delta again but only as a last resort. Having said that the flights were all on time or early maybe lucky but I'd hate to be delayed if the only wine they had onboard in 'coach' was what they gave me on those flights. One more thing although they had VOD the content on offer was very limited with only a handful of movies on offer (in contrast BA usually offer > 30 movies with similar ratios for TV and Music).
2551,4,27,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville NC canceled due to mechanical problem. Their solution was to spend the night in Atlanta at our cost and fly to Jacksonville 20 hours later. Ended up fling to Raleigh and renting a car at our cost and driving to Jacksonville. They are not concerned in the least. Will avoid Delta in the future.
2552,9,22,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight from MSN to LGA going east was very good. Return west was very poor with cancellation of late night flight and re-booking for next morning and long (2.5 hours) delay on morning flight due to a mechanical problem after plane was loaded and de-icing equipment issue in Mid-April at LGA. Very long and stressful flight experience.
2553,1,21,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flew LHR-JFK and connecting internal flights to MCO. Excellent service at the airport and onboard. Very helpful and friendly cabin crew on all legs of the journey. Planes were clean and comfortable despite being a little old. Flight crews were very informative about potential turbulence flight times etc. There was a good selection of up to date movies and TV series available on personal entertainment screens for the long haul parts. Cabin crew would frequently offer drinks served dinner and a breakfast plus newspapers and other amenities on this section. Punctual and a pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again.
2554,7,16,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Madison WI to Gainesville FL via Atlanta. Flight delayed by a few hours leaving Madison. There was a decent snowstorm going on at the time and I presumed that was the cause of the delay. Arrived late in Atlanta and just missed the connecting flight to Gainesville. Delta staff at Atlanta said the delay was actually due to mechanical reasons and promptly provided meal and hotel vouchers for an excellent hotel and rebooking on the first flight the following morning. Obviously the delayed flight is a negative but in this particular case Delta efficiently made adequate accommodations for stranded passengers in a situation where it would have been easy for them to blame the weather and refuse to make accommodations at all. For that they deserve some commendation.
2555,2,15,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Horrible service horrible planes Delta does not care about their passengers. No matter what happens they only have on excuse - technical problems with the plane. I booked my flights with Delta because the price is usually $30-50 cheaper but I've learned my lesson - it's not worth it. (I fly about 10 times a year and have done so for last 6 years) I don't remember their flight being ever on time. They've failed 100 out of 100 times. I wish everyone would stop flying with them just to show them that in order to stay in business they have to take care of their customers.
2556,1,14,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service.
2557,7,14,April,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care. I won't be flying Delta again not if I can help it at least. U.S air was on time and staff was very friendly.
2558,7,13,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,France,Not Specified,"AF3628 (operated by Delta) Paris-NY JFK 6th April. Extremely disappointed with Delta the only normal element was that the flight was on time. The staff service was not pleasant and not helpful. The lavatory (even before taking off) was dirty. No newspapers (we'll give you whatever will be left after business class passengers have been served). The food was appalling and a horrible non-descript sandwich (which almost everyone put aside) should not be called a ""meal"". What a trip."
2559,10,13,April,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,I went DTW-SFO AND SFO-DTW. Took Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300 both ways. The seat comfort was great! There was a lot of leg room. The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't smiling that much or very polite. There was a lot of food selection and prices were decent. We got complimentary drinks twice which was great. The inflight entertainment system has a ton of selection although most of the movies and tv shows cost money. But the music selection was amazing so it was great. Overall the Delta flights were really good and I would definitely fly it again.
2560,9,8,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Extremely dissatisfied with Delta. Original flight delayed with no explanation. Missed connecting flight by 5 minutes. The next flight I was able to get on and still make my appointment at my destination - at boarding time was advised of ""mechanical issues"" and not sure of length of delay. For the price of airfare this lack of service and commitment is unacceptable."
2561,10,8,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for.
2562,6,2,April,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,DL010 ATL-LHR on 7th March. Very tight connection from Dallas through Atlanta made the flight with minutes to spare and my bags made it onto the flight too! Extremely attentive cabin staff comfortable lie flat bed good selection of food and drink IFE was a little dated but didn't mind as was tired and needed the sleep. Flight arrived early quick bag delivery. All round great experience.
2563,5,30,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Germany,Not Specified,Our flight from LAX to JFK was on time and we arrived earlier than planned. Service was a little slow due to the reason they don't accept cash payment for meals and Credit Card verification wasn't that fast. Inflight entertainment was really good!
2564,8,30,March,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Economy Comfort DTW-LAX on a 767-300 and LAX-DTW on a 737-900. To LAX the 767-300 seat was good although it did not have the adjustable headrest. Multiple drink runs and plenty of cookies peanuts and pretzels. Personal entertainment had okay choices. Back to DTW the 737-900 was great. Seats were very comfortable. Again multiple drink runs and lots of snacks. Purchased the fruit/cheese tray and tapas both of which were very good. The personal entertainment had tons of movies. Overall - very good experience. I hope that all aircraft get seats with adjustable headrests as they do make a difference on a 4+ hour flight.
2565,0,30,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Germany,Not Specified,We had a very good flight from DUS to LAX with transfer in ATL. Service on both flights was good even if meals on the inner-USA flight were not for free.
2566,2,26,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome"" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice. After 6 hours on a rather uncomfortable seat we started our decent with yet again the sarcastic hostess picking out her two favorite passengers and offering them secret mimosas while the rest of us looked on. Not a good experience pretty frustrating and undoubtedly embarrassing."
2567,3,26,March,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Paid $622 for so-called Sky Priority First Class from Detroit to Tampa. What a joke! My checked bag was taken off the non-stop because they were overweight. I guess Sky Priority means they ditch your bag before everyone else. Planes are filthy. First class lavatory filthy. First class crowded with coach passengers using forward lavatory. No attempt by FAs to deter this. First overheads filled with coach luggage. Several first class flights last year on AA were terrific also first on Icelandair - also terrific. Save your money - Delta is now a low cost low service airline do not bother to pay for First class.
2568,10,26,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,3/24/14 I was set to departing from Atlanta to Greensboro NC on flight DL4933 and returning from Greensboro NC to Atlanta on DL1461. Upon boarding I noticed that there was a climate issue on the flight where half of the plane was extremely cold and the back half of the flight was unbearably hot. I was not the only passenger to complain to no avail to the flight staff. After about 30min on the runway with no movement we were notified that there was an engine malfunction and all passengers would need to depart the aircraft. We were told at 8.50am that the maintenance would take an hour at the most. It is now 10.33am and there has been no resolution to the situation. The ladies at the customer care center across from D27 have been the only people to attempt to assist me. I attempted to inform the representatives at the departure gate (D13) that I was attempting to go to a funeral and any options would be appreciated and they stated that they understood and asked me to take a seat and wait. As a result of my flight not being ready to depart Atlanta at 10.40am and the viewing in Winston-Salem NC beginning at 11.00am I was unable to pay my respects.
2569,5,24,March,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flew Washington to London via Atlanta. Flight from Washington to Atlanta was fine drinks service and pretzels provided however bad weather meant the service was suspended. Annoying the flight was full and warnings were given about hand luggage due to the flight being full however quite a lot of other passengers had loads of luggage including massive cases that would normally be checked in. Flight from Atlanta to London was fine meal service delayed due to bad weather but meal was tasty and full drinks service offered. On demand TV with good selection would definitely fly Delta again.
2570,1,24,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,BOS-ATL-LIM-ATL-BOS in Business Class. Flight experience was excellent. Great crews very comfortable lay-flat bed seating wonderful IFE superb meals. Additionally very good wines offered. I have never had aged wines on a flight before. The return from LIM to ATL was canceled due to a mechanical issue and DL had to fly the part down on their flight from ATL the next day. DL did a commendable job accommodating the over 200 passengers. Excellent pro-active customer service. The only part of this trip that was any type of letdown was the Club in ATL in Terminal E. The Club was packed the seating awkward and uncomfortable the food offerings pretty bad and the Wifi so slow it was unusable. The BOS Club was great however. All in all a very good experience yet again with DL.
2571,0,22,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew Jan 22 from Burlington VT to Tampa FL. They changed planes giving us a smaller one so they ran out of seats they offered compensation took the flight up to Atlanta GA. No heating on plane we were freezing attendants kept there coats on for the trip. No hot drinks peanuts pretzels or soft drinks. Next flight to Tampa was ok on way back the plane land in LaGuardia NY put us onboard waited an 1 hour before leaving while the plane was being de-iced they had only one truck there to de-ice 3 planes. They compensate us with peanuts and pretzels - very disappointed with Delta.
2572,2,17,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew GSO to CZM through ATL. We received complimentary upgrades to business class. The meal was the best meal I have had on a plane and the sandwich and puree would have rivalled sandwich shops. Everything was excellent. The seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were helpful and courteous. Highly recommend.
2573,10,17,March,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Our flight to Tulsa has been delayed for almost 5 hours. During this time we have not been given satisfactory updates. We've only been told mechanical difficulties. 5 hours later they are still trying to decide if they will bring another plane. I will not fly Delta in the future.
2574,2,17,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL1467 13 Mar ATL-SAN. Flight operated with 767 equipment. As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously. This was true Delta service from the heart and was to me a benchmark of what DL can be. Even though I am a Million Miler I was impressed by one of the best flights I have had.
2575,10,17,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew DL007 from DXB to ATL. I have traveled this flight 12 or more times. Most of the time my experience is always positive. This specific trip the IFE was not working very well for the first 3+ hours of the flight. They had to reset the system about 4 or 5 times. I was seated in 44J (Exit row window seat). I always sit in Row 44 which is the row with nothing in front of you. I am a frequent flyer so I have this option. The food was decent. The mid flight snack is normally just a turkey sandwich and a mini banana. You can normally get one drink with your meal just ask for it. The flight attendants are very kind every time on this flight. Sometimes you get a joker too. The bathrooms always become quite disgusting but that's understandable on a 15 hour flight. I enjoyed my flight but will be flying Business class with my miles next flight.
2576,5,17,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew CZM to ATL. We were supposed to leave on 28th January but didn't end up leaving until 30th January. This obviously wasn't the airlines fault so you cannot give them a worse score for the weather. We were complimentary upgraded to business class on this flight but since the plane had landed the night prior they didn't have the hot meal we received on the way down. They did however give us all the cookies and chips and any other snacks they had. Along with liquor. The seats were very comfortable and the flight attendants were very courteous. Overall a great flight.
2577,0,14,March,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Rochester to Ft Lauderdale through Atlanta 3/6/14 - 3/9/14. I was very happy with two aspects and unhappy with one. We taxied from the gate in Atlanta found there were tornadoes in Florida and turned back to the gate. The speed with which we were told what happened and with which Delta decided to bring us back to the gate were beyond anything I've recently experienced from the airlines. I was very impressed with the kindness and quick solution when I got home after the trip realized I left a book on the plane called the airport held it for me and I got it back two days later. My one complaint was with the one hour line to get through TSA at 5 am March 9 in Ft Lauderdale-I think Delta blames this on TSA. Overall very satisfied with Delta.
2578,2,12,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,PHL-CDG-PHL on a Boeing 757ER. Went on a family vacation to Paris back in July 2013. Leaving Philly the flight left on time at 9pm and got to Paris 30 minutes early around 10.15am. Flight wasn't full so I went to an empty row to lay down for the almost 8hr flight. Each seat had TV's in the headrest and the plane had wifi but flying over the Atlantic ocean the wifi didn't. The food served wasn't the best and the complimentary breakfast was a joke they gave us OJ a banana and a blueberry muffin. Leaving Paris we had an hour delay because of a storm and when we finally boarded the plane we had another half hour delay because a family of 10 had a virus and were all forced to get off. My original seat flying from Paris was changed without any notification prior to the vacation. Luckily my mother checked the flights each day to make sure nothing bad happened to our flights. The flight was full minus the family who got kicked off the plane. For the almost 8hr flight you would think they would use a 2 aisle plane instead of one. My TV didn't work. For long haul flights I doubt I'll take Delta again.
2579,9,12,March,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Feb 25th flight DL4884 DL4938 / March 4TH DL5355 DL892 DL4682. I had not ever flown with Delta before last week. I have been very impressed with the customer service as well as the price. Atlanta airport was daunting first time round but the second visit was much easier to work through.
2580,7,3,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight 2395 PBI-LGA on a MD-88 aircraft on July 30th. Only positive was an on time flight. Thankful this flight wasn't any longer then it was. Experience was awful and I felt very unwelcome as if I was an inconvenience. Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on. Restrooms in rear were out of order leaving everyone on the plane to have to all use the one restroom in first class. Took about 30 minutes to receive my luggage at baggage claim. Overall not a pleasant experience.
2581,0,3,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I have flown Delta for years because I live in metro Detroit. I am a frequent flyer and am in many ways ""stuck"" but after this experience I am going to find an alternative. I am sure my business does not matter however I think if one person tells one other and so on perhaps customers can have a voice! It is a shame that people cannot be treated better!"
2582,0,3,March,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Germany,Not Specified,CDG-MIN-DFW - great service - nice staff - managed to get me and my luggage in an 1 hour connection (got on the plane 15 min before take off).
2583,0,27,February,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,I was travelling with my teenage son and 3 others on a flight to Boston. We received excellent service from everyone. The attendants encouraged our tall teenage boys to move to seats with more legroom as the flight was not full and supplied them with all the refreshments they asked for with a smile. They gave us great advise for when we landed. Extra cups of tea were not a problem and also came with delicious cookies! Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms. They again encouraged us to move for more room and once again all refreshments were served with a smile.
2584,3,25,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Long and short of it is that it took a succession of 5 aircrafts last week to get from Detroit to Burlington VT. The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5. I usually fly Delta and have generally found their service to be very good. However they need to address the Customer Service issues in Detroit.
2585,8,22,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,"Flew from Seattle to Vegas on a ""cosy"" CRJ900. Service was friendly seat comfortable and snacks and drinks on offer were good for a 1hr 45min. Flight and bags were first on the carousel easily worth the extra $70 IMO."
2586,8,22,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,DL002 London Heathrow to JFK 15th Feb returned on 21st Feb flight KL6005 JFK to London Heathrow. This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this. Flying home from JFK seats were not allocated until the gate meaning on a night flight my daughter was on the opposite side of the plane to myself.
2587,0,21,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Feb 7 2014. Frankfurt (Germany) to NYC (USA). All in all I had one of the best long distance flights in a while. The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta.
2588,10,21,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,After visiting Tucson AZ I was embarking on my return journey from Tucson to Edinburgh via Atlanta and Paris on Monday 17th Feb. The incoming flight from Atlanta arrived more or less on time but as soon as it landed it was clear there was a problem with the aircraft. It turns out that none of the lavatories were functional. This caused a severe delay making me reschedule my entire journey one day later. I was offered a hotel - which was fine - and given what was described to me as meal vouchers. These were not fine. They were in fact practically useless pieces of paper. No one took the time to explain that they were only valued at $6. A fact I was also unaware of until I came to pay and pay I did. As far as I am concerned if I am given a meal voucher I expect a meal. In fact this worthless piece of paper does not buy anything on the menu - even a bowl of soup. To add insult to injury there was no breakfast voucher at all. American airlines already have a bad reputation so perhaps I should not have expected better.
2589,9,21,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Was scheduled from Milwaukee to Detroit to Norfolk VA on Thursday 2/13. Our plane in MKE was delayed over an hour because of weather. Because of that we missed our connection to Norfolk. The captain said we'd be rebooked on the next flight - we weren't. My three traveling companions and I couldn't be rebooked until Saturday 2/15 after our event was over. Delta's customer ""service"" area in the Detroit airport consist of a bank of phones with no human beings present. We were continually bounced between phone representatives and gate agents with neither being helpful. We ended up renting a car and driving (yes over 12 hrs) Avoid Delta at all costs."
2590,9,18,February,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL 1169 MIA to LAX Feb 13 2014. It is impossible to get an upgrade as a Platinum Medallion between Florida and California on Delta. In addition the system wide upgrades are never available. Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch. My trip yesterday was like a 5 hour closed MRI. It is sad to see great airline go down the tubes in rewarding loyalty.
2591,8,17,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"February 1 2014. CDG (Paris) to SEA (Seattle-Tacoma). I would have given Delta a higher score an 8 out of 10 for trip satisfaction but the seats on the aircraft were very uncomfortable (the worst I've experienced). The recline was minimal which made it impossible for me to sleep. I had to remove the catalogue / inflight magazine from the seat pocket in front of me in order to gain a 1/2 inch or so of leg space. I considered upgrading to economy comfort but only available seats were by the toilets and the seats were described as having ""up to"" 4 inches of additional leg room but no mention of additional recline. The seats are acceptable short flights but not for long-haul travel."
2592,3,17,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I recently flew to Fort Wayne from Philly. Both ways had a lay over so I flew 4 separate planes. Of the 4 I had a broken seat on 3 of them. Not able to recline on 2 because it was broken and the other I had a broken seat cushion that repeatedly slid off making the flight that much more comfortable as I had to keep standing and fixing it. At least I was able to enjoy a beverage. Oh no I was not because 2 flights did not serve any and the last leg of my journey the 3 flight ""attendants"" were unable to fully serve the plan in the 70 min we were in the air. I have taken 20 min flights in Europe where I get served fresh tea and a biscuit by one flight steward for the entire plane. If ever have the displeasure of flying your airline I will be sure to bring duck tape a tool box and a coke so I can be comfortable."
2593,1,10,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,Flew JNB-ATL-SNA on Feb 6 2014. Departure from JNB on time though boarding was a bit chaotic. Economy class seating on B77L from JNB-ATL ok. Weber slimline seats are a quite firm and this becomes ever more evident on this long 16 hour flight. Cabin crew most unfriendly and really did not want to be providing the on board services. In flight meals very poor. Cabin crew on ATL-SNA flight a little better. AVOD on B77L very good with excellent picture quality and selections.

The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight. The only real downside is that it cost me nearly double the frequent flier miles to fly for free than it had cost me when I flew Delta to Dublin in 2000. All in all a very positive experience.

2596,9,10,February,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,I flew from DUB-JFK-PHX. The transatlantic leg was enjoyable. The flight attendants did several drink runs although they only pour half a can unlike other airlines. Each passenger had their own personal backseat TV and the movie/music/game selection was fantastic. Headphones are provided for those didn't bring their own. Toilets were clean and hot towels are provided to freshen up. The second leg from JFK-PHX was less impressive. Entertainment is provided by an old CRT monitor in the centre of the aisle meaning you have no choice in what you watch. Expect old sitcom reruns. No meals on this flight either despite it being nearly as long as DUB-JFK. The boredom of this flights combined with my hunger meant I couldn't wait to get off. Conclusion: fly Delta transatlantic but avoid for domestic flights within the USA.
2597,2,3,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have flown Delta 3 round trips in the past 3 months. The first flight had an engine problem over the Atlantic and we had to make an emergency landing in Canada and were forced to sit on the plane for 6 hours waiting for a new plane. I do have to say the crew was great. Missing my connection I arrived home a day late. My second flight was normal with no issues. My trip had another engine problem. This time before take-off. Instead of getting home on Friday night I had to wait until Saturday night to get home. The crews and ground staff have been great but Delta is not maintaining its planes.
2598,8,3,February,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Honolulu to LA First class. Lucked out got a flight that was inbound from Japan so configuration was Intl business. Normally Hawaii routes get the oldest planes with the least amount of comfort. This was a wonderful surprise. Complemented by a wonderful crew that was eager to please with warm excellent service this flight was a pleasure. Great entertainment nice lunch warm service and tail winds.
2599,8,3,February,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,BKK-NRT-BKK in Business Elite on B747. Don't fly Delta much and was impressed with the product. Seats comfortable and private whilst seated on upper deck. Cabin ambience pleasant service attentive and professional IFE above average. In general a cut above the other American carriers and significantly better than the previous Delta international business product. Only disappointment was not having Premium Lane cards for arrival in BKK. BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK. I enquired about it with the crew and they were baffled and seemed to have no idea with what I was talking about as if they had never heard of it. Other than that very nice experience.
2600,10,31,January,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,January 15th SLC to CDG. I would have purchased an economy comfort seat for the extra $210 but the only available ones were by the toilets. My economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have experienced on a long flight - inadequate seat padding and very limited recline. Otherwise the flight was acceptable the food edible the FAs competent performance on time. Next time I fly to Europe I'll avoid Delta on account of my experience with the uncomfortable seat. Based on my experience on this trip I would not recommend Delta to friends and family. I may fly Delta again but only on short domestic trips.
2601,0,29,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"GSO-BKK and return via ATL and NRT. All flights on time and no issues with check in and boarding. All the long distance flights were on 747-400. Although you can no longer call these the ""Queen of the Sky"" they still give a comfortable reassuring ride. Delta can be complimented on upgrading their business class product. The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights. To compete with the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers though Delta needs to brush up on a few areas. In particular the menu selections and service need to be better but my biggest gripe is with the bathrooms which fully reflect the 25 year age of the plane and at the end of a 13 hour flight. I shall say no more."
2602,10,25,January,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Singapore,Not Specified,SIN-NRT return. DL 622 and DL 621. Both flights were on 777-200ER equipped with on demand ptv. SIN-NRT: Could not find the USB port to charge my phones on the flight to NRT. Hot breakfast was served at local time 8 am 2hrs into the flight. Hot snack of chicken wrap was served 2 hrs before landing. The odd part was the entertainment programmes were switched off 4 hrs into the flight with no explanation. Most passengers were asleep due to the early departure of the flight at 5.45 am. NRT-SIN: USB port was installed beside the PTV. Hot dinner was served 2 hrs into the flight. Snack of ice cream were served 2 hrs before landing. Crew of Chinese national and Singaporean crew were helpful. Asked if passengers wanted extra ice cream. Self help galley provided Evian water only. DL offers the cheapest fare for direct flights to Japan and will travel with them again.
2603,8,20,January,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,ATL-LAS December 2013. Main and pretty much only issue was legroom. In certain configurations of their 757-200 seats 2C/D are bulkhead seats where we were seated and legroom is severely restricted. Other than that it was a pretty average/decent experience. A snack basket containing the typical peanuts pretzels and chocolates was passed around twice. Flight attendants were courteous. The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath. PTVs were also available with an excellent selection of holiday and other films. Since the flight departed around 9:30pm no complimentary dinner was served. All in all it was an OK flight just beware of the first class bulkhead seats on certain 757 configurations.
2604,5,20,January,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,While the flight attendants on all the Delta flights were nice I've noticed the planes they use aren't the best of quality/maybe not well maintained and their customer service seems non-existent. On a flight I took recently from Moscow to NYC during both take off and landing the roof of the plane was leaking a lot of water (over passengers). If you were sitting in a window seat (like me) it seemed to leak quite a lot enough to get you wet. The leaking eventually stopped when the plane was higher up in the air. The flight attendants couldn't really do anything about it since it was an issue with the plane itself. I left bad feedback on the flight and filed a complaint and Delta never seems to respond. So next time I fly I will probably read more reviews on air carriers and try to pick one that's known for better service.
2605,10,16,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew on December 19 DEN-ATL-SRQ and return all flights were on time even with all the delays in the NE. One flight had PTV's on a 757 which was very nice other 3 flights on a md's nicely updated with power outlets in economy comfort which was very nice. Greeted nicely at each gate by name. All staff very professional and better than Delta or American without a doubt!
2606,3,15,January,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL1954 on 12/30 and DL1910 on 1/1/14. Checking in with first class with Delta was nice because we got advanced security clearance. The rest was disappointing. I guess I am used to first class with American. Snacks offered were like sombody's left over Halloween treats. There was no music or entertainment offered.
2607,0,15,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Flew LHR-CUN (via ATL outbound and MSP return) in Business Elite. Pre-flight customer service (via Twitter) was excellent with the one or two queries we had. Check-in fast track security and lounge at LHR T4 very good - much better than BA at T5. Seats (flat beds) very good although foot area a little compact - we're 5'6 and 5'8 so taller travellers may be less happy. Pillow and duvet very comfortable. Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage. On board service excellent and friendly - on the outbound flight two crew (including the purser) came round with chocolates and thanked us for flying Delta they really sounded like they meant it. Will definitely fly Delta transatlantic again.
2608,10,14,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew from JFK to Las Vegas January 9-12. Check-in was very good even at 6am. I liked the bistro in the waiting area. The plane was clean and orderly. The only real disappointment was the food and drink selection offered with the flight a tablespoon of peanuts or a shy dozen of mini-pretzels. The real disappointment (inflight) was with the entertainment as in none. The screen was jumping (and audio) as if the VCR was old and the screens had rainbow colors to them as if the TV's were well past their prime. Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it. For $600+ a seat it should be a lot better especially since last year was a banner year for profits for the airlines. How sad. This is America's best? Hey Delta pay it forward and invest in your equipment.
2609,10,14,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Used Delta from JFK to Fort Lauderdale and have to say that the experience was far from first class. Before takeoff a lady got on in a dishevelled state and distributed bottled water after she had stowed her luggage in an overhead locker. It turned out she was an off duty stewardess helping out the on duty staff. During the flight drinks were served and a banana was thrown to the first class passengers by way of food. The only good thing to be said was that the flight was on time.
2610,0,13,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My husband and 1 year old daughter was flying today (01/11/2014) from Charlotte to Albany through Detroit. Their flight got delayed 1 hr due to some mechanical repairs. Then they missed their connecting flight to Albany due to that delay. They ended up waiting from 12 Noon to 8pm for their next flight to Albany. By 8pm their flight got cancelled and got a new schedule for tomorrow. With connecting flight from Detroit-Atlanta-Albany. I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. This type of incident happens for us for the third time. Very bad service of flights.
2611,7,9,January,2014,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Singapore,Not Specified,SIN-NRT-SIN. Economy. Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future.
2612,8,9,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flying round trip from Columbus OH to Las Vegas through Detroit. Jan 3-6 2014. Delta gate agents are rude and abrupt. They were late getting me to my connection in DTW due to computer problems during boarding at the gate in Columbus. I made it to the gate in DTW 12 min before departure but the agent had given away my seat and said sternly that it was to late and to go complain at gate A43. I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being.
2613,9,8,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew from LAX to Haneda (12/22/2013) and from Narita to LAX (12/29/2013). Flights were on time in fact earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were very courteous not typical of attendants of United States airlines. The online check in and baggage drop center that takes baggage more than 3 hours before flight time make travel a breeze.
2614,1,8,January,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew during the chaos caused by the weather the delays wer understandable. Leaving mass the staff at Logan assisted me with my sick child by being attentive and making us as comfortable as they could. When we stopped in JFK again the staff were very pleasant while we waited 3 hours to board to Dominican Rep. Staff did what they could to keep passengers entertained. On the other hand I feel like customer service stops in the US while in the Dominican Rep I felt like I was dealing with a whole different airline. staff were rude and inconsiderate. Delta needs to take time to train their Dominican staff.
2615,0,7,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I was on this flight which was delayed by over 2 hours in Atlanta and never once were we given the reason for the delay. That's fine. A delay is a delay. Here is where it gets interesting. Once we boarded this old DC plane the cabin crew promptly made an announcement that they had ""forgotten"" to load water to the tanks. So even though the flush would work there would be no water from the faucets to wash our hands. Instead there was just a bottle of water kept in the toilet. Yes that was my Delta experience! I met another traveler in Mexico a few days later who apparently flew the same flight two days later and had the same water issue. This really explains why I should avoid Delta in the future! Absolutely no customer service."
2616,2,6,January,2014,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Philippines,Not Specified,Economy Comfort Manila to Tokyo Narita. The extra $39 is well worth it. Much more peaceful cabin and priority boarding. The extra recline and seat pitch really made a difference. Flight attendants anticipated the needs of passengers. consistently offering snacks and refreshments. they were very courteous and tried to address the concerns of passengers as best they can. I also appreciated the fact that they took the extra effort of addressing me by my name. It was very thoughtful of them.
2617,3,4,January,2014,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL0117 on 12/29/13 STR to ATL on 767-300ER. 1x2x1 config in Delta's premium cabin remains unbeatable service levels w/Delta generally consistent. This flight even surprised on the upside: excellent menu out of STR and a top notch cabin crew. Is it a throw back to times past when an attendant cares to monitor your Scotch remains 'easy ice' i.e. bring an additional ice cube when needed and without being prodded? That was a crew that made it a joy to fly over the Holidays. Delta wins on many levels these days.
2618,0,3,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,New Orleans to Boston. A blizzard was headed for the Boston area and delays were expected. Was charged $100 because my luggage was 2.3 lbs over weight. I asked a man working at the ticket area to help me transfer to an earlier flight in order to beat the storm. He told me he would put me on standby and directed me toward a gate. Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby. Lady then put me in standby and told me she would call my name if a seat opened up. Everyone began to board the flight and my name had not been called just as they were closing the gate the lady yelled at me to get on the plane. Ran down the ramp. Flight staff were OK landed a little early. Things went much smoother in Atlanta.
2619,0,2,January,2014,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Florida to Seattle flights delayed due to weather and would miss connection in Atlanta. Understandable. Ticket agent wanted to send me to Atlanta and sit on standby. Whereby I was not guaranteed a seat and no hotel meal compensation. Had agent book me on flight early next day instead. Booked seat from Florida to Atlanta but no seat booked from Atlanta to Seattle by agent and now on standby. Tried to assign seat over internet but was blocked because agent put me on standby. Called Delta and was informed that the airport agents now had control and could not book a seat. Told telephone agent to let me speak to supervisor as I was looking at 25 empty seats on their website. Agent spoke to supervisor and supervisor assigned me a seat. Now why couldn't other agent have done that hours earlier? Arrived at baggage check-on area (already had boarding passes) for ""red-eye"" return trip from Seattle. Stood in line watching understaffed agents for 20 minutes and was told when we finally got to the front of the line that we had missed the baggage check-in window by 3 minutes. Keep in mind we had already stood in line 20 minutes. Told to go to the Special Services line. Got in Special Services line and stood for 15 minutes. By now not only had my wife and I missed checking our bags but we had now missed the flight. Told by ""red coated"" Supervisor is that all they could do was put us on standby for a 11.25 pm ""red-eye"" flight with no guarantee we could even get on the plane as there were no seats available. As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later. When we asked where we could find a hotel she pointed the directions to the hotel board center and basically said we were on our own. The last straw was they lost our baggage on the return flight. Finally came in on the next flight after midnight next day."
2620,7,30,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Germany,Not Specified,2 hours flight between Atlanta and Nassau. Business class ticket. Very old and noisy aircraft (MD88). Business class seats OK. Sky Priority boarding. Except bananas and bretzel and drinks do not expect any meal served at dinner time even for a 1500 USD ticket. No lounge access for this international destination except if you have the right frequent flyer status. I will avoid to fly them again for this amount of money.
2621,4,29,December,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We made reservations way in advance prepaid our flights and chose the seats that best accommodated our needs. Delta then changed the flights on several occasions and reassigned our seats giving us the worst possible seating even having our kids separate from us. We called customer service and were told they could not do anything that they are not allowed to change other people's seats. That is exactly what they did to us! We learned our lesson the hard way and we hope to never have to fly Delta again.
2622,10,29,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I recently took a trip from Huntsville AL to OKC from Nov 21-Dec 27th. I found my first flight to be a very pleasant experience but what impressed me was how my return flight was handled. We were late I was due to depart at 3.30 and by the time I checked in it was 3.21. I was booked on the 6.10 flight right then and there. The staff didn't even charge a fee for having to change my flight.
2623,2,25,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,To Las Vegas from Jacksonville Florida. The plane we were on from Atlanta to Las Vegas a long flight had no leg room and there were two large men and me in a row! On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there! And went right back to their discussion.
2624,10,23,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,BOS-AMS-BOS Dec 2013. I don't know when they put the upgraded Airbus 330s into service but it's as good as any business service I've seen on a US carrier. 1-2-1 seating so if you're by the window you're not trapped if the person next to you is in full recline mode. In the usual 2-2-2 format I've always avoided the window but on this service the window seat at 9J worked very well. The seats are on the narrow side for business but you get an individual pod that's narrower in the front (where your feet go) wider in the back; the seats have full recline. Cabin staff on both flights were senior attentive and friendly. On AMS-BOS the genial captain came back before take-off to chat up everyone in business individually. I only used the A/V to track flight progress but the screen is large and pops out of the pod wall. The pillow was comfortable. The amenities kit is about average - the usual socks etc. but nothing special and they don't offer the business amenity that my wife really likes - PJ''s.
2625,8,23,December,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Czech Republic,Not Specified,"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience."
2626,2,23,December,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,"Newark to LA via Minneapolis. I arrived at Newark airport with plenty of time before my flight was due to leave. I was then told via the computer alert system that my flight was one hour delayed. After a one hour delay I was allowed to board the flight. We then proceed to sit on the runway for another hour and as a consequence I missed my connection. Once I landed in Minneapolis I was told (very abruptly and rudely) that I had missed the flight and was told to then search for my new boarding pass in amongst a sea of boarding passes of others who had also missed their flights because handing them out individually would have been too easy and maybe make sense? I then proceeded through the airport to the baggage reclaim and customer information area where I asked the Delta airlines representative whether there was any available food for people who had missed their flights. She told me that if I wanted something to eat I had to order a pizza. Last but not certainly not least when I was finally able to pick up my rucksack from the Delta ""office"" I was wearing a sling due to a shoulder injury. Delta staff in the office watched me struggle to pick up my backpack for around ten minutes before finally I actually had to ask them for help. I must say though through all my complaining I had two okay stewardesses on that flight however the rest of the Delta staff were rude and inconsiderate."
2627,4,20,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Philippines,Not Specified,"MNL-NRT-JFK (B744/Premium Economy) EWR-ATL(A319/Y) ATL-SNA (B757/Y) SNA-MSP (A319/Y) MSP-EWR (A320/Y) and JFK- NRT-MNL (B744/Y). In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth. Not only did I get a whole lot of extra space and privacy but extra TV monitors pillow and blankets as well. Much much better than premium economy but at no extra cost. It was an overall pleasant experience flying DL this time."
2628,7,20,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"DAL 417 LAX to SYD and DAL 16 from SYD to LAX. Both legs on Delta's 777-200LR in seat 7A. Used kiosk for check-in at both LAX and SYD. The Delta ""business class"" lounge at LAX is nothing more than Delta's normal ""Sky Club"" the facility was overcrowded and like being inside an extremely loud bar. The flights pushed back pretty much on time. Delta's 777-200LR is getting a bit worn looking and the herringbone ""suites"" that face away from the windows (as opposed to the much-better window-facing suites used by carriers like Cathay Pacific) had walls so low that privacy was minimal. I was lucky enough to have seat 7A on both flights; 7A has the advantage of having a closet next to the seat which in effect forms a cave that the seat reclines back into. The set-up is very good for allowing sleep. The flight crews were LA-based both directions seemed to be made up of senior FA's and on balance did a really nice service both directions. The flights featured three meal services - dinner/lunch a mid-flight snack and a light breakfast. The forward and mid galleys had a variety of low end snacks available throughout the flight. The AVOD system is OK (screen sizer and location) but nothing special but it does have available a fairly broad selection of movies. The best part of the flights was my ability to sleep. I am a large guy and I've had real trouble trying to sleep in the flat-bed first and business seats used by British Air Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Delta was a refreshing change. I got 7-8 solid hours of quality sleep time on both flights. Part of the reason is that the FA's move the meal service process along efficiently and get the cabin lights down early into the flight. On arrival although Delta offers BusinessElite passengers a fast-track immigration/customs pass I didn't use them because as a TSA Global Entry cardholder I was able to use the kiosks in both Sydney and LAX. As I only had carryons the total time from plane until I was out of the airport could not have been more than 10 minutes. In the past I've normally flown on Qantas to/from Australia and New Zealand but with Delta's codeshare arrangement with Virgin Australia (an excellent carrier by the way in all respects) and given my outstanding recent experience on Delta's 777 I plan to continue using Delta for my travel to/from Oceania."
2629,8,17,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew DL7 Dubai to Atlanta. Excellent service from staff. Yes I am short so I fit into the sleeper seat and yes if I were taller it would not be a good fit. Screen on entertainment is adequate. Staff was warm attentive and friendly.
2630,0,17,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,We left unreasonably early (6 hours ahead) to drop off our rental car and to accommodate the weather. While on route to the airport Delta left a voicemail that our flight was delayed so we would miss our next flight home. He looked up another potential flight and asked if we were able to make it to a flight that should have been boarding as we spoke. So it seemed unlikely that we would make it but it was delayed. So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours. They could not accommodate us for an inconvenience that was not our fault without an extra charge of one hundred dollars. I'm not satisfied with my service from Delta Airlines to say the least.
2631,7,16,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I had to make a last minute trip (same day round-trip) to SFO from LAX on 12/12/2013. I have not flown in economy in years except for Southwest but chose Delta as their price was much lower than Southwest (first class not worth it for this short of flight in my opinion): I booked this trip 10 days in advance. While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport. I still love Southwest but on this route I have now found a better airline.
2632,10,16,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL) to San Francisco (SFO). I was originally supposed to fly from ATL into SJC (San Jose) but was later rebooked Dec 6th and Dec 7th. I missed my connection because the plane was first over- fuelled then under-fuelled and then there were issues with the ""paperwork."" In Atlanta I was forced to call Delta call center (huge lines to speak with customers representatives on site) to rebook my flight was asked to hold for 30 minutes. When I called again they told me I was holding for no reason because the representative had hung up on my call. My bag is also missing."
2633,5,16,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Outward Manchester UK to Miami via Atlanta 5/12/13 and return from Fort Lauderdale 12/12/13. Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals. Apart from the attitude towards a cancelled flight no issues at all with Delta and would certainly fly with them again.
2634,8,12,December,2013,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,ATL-JFK Thanksgiving week. Despite Diamond status I was with 2 family members so no upgrade O/B but still managed Economy comfort. Pretty good for 2 hour flight although no IFE. As it was thanksgiving I expected the worst but flight took off on time and landed early. On the return all 3 managed to get upgraded to first. Again pretty good for Thanksgiving Sunday. Landed on time bags already on belt by the time we hauled ourselves from E terminal to bag claim. Overall not bad apart from the price ($500 r/t each) but again it was thanksgiving!
2635,0,10,December,2013,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,MSP-JFK-MXP and return 4 days later. Economy comfort. First time doing this route as I prefer going into and out of Linate - Milan but short notice trip forced itinerary. Very surprised and pleased with the 767 leg (JFK- Milan) wider seats and quieter cabin than the A330's used on MSP-AMS. CRJ 9XX on the way out a bit small for a 2.5 hr flight A319 on return bigger but noisy. JFK transfer a bit of a hassle with on-going construction but new terminal is nice improvement. MXP was a pain to exit on return. Overall Delta experience is improving and remains a decent choice from MSP to Europe. I still prefer Linate over Malpensa at least for now.
2636,7,9,December,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,ONT-SLC-CDG-AMS-MME on 2-3 December (some of the flights were on AF and KL metal but it was a Delta ticket with DL flight numbers for all the segments). An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.
2637,0,6,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I started flying Delta about a year ago and surprisingly there wasn't much to complain about. After reading a few reviews I was a bit sceptical but I flew them from SIN-NRT-JFK and I enjoyed the flight more than SQ. The flight attendants were warmer and friendly while we departed on time and on schedule without delays. The legroom was better than SQ and was worth the extra cost. The food although small in portions was not as bad as I expected. Overall I would recommend flying Delta.
2638,9,4,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,ATL-LGA-ATL first class. Very motivated crew on both flights who seemed genuinely concerned about the well-being of the passengers. Catering was adequate for a 2-hour flight although the meal uploaded in Atlanta was of better quality than the one served on the return. Return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours due to mechanical issues but the crew handled it well and tried to assist passengers with connections. Seats somewhat cramped and no IFE on the A320 and A319 I flew on but I was favorably impressed with the crew.
2639,0,3,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,DL 80/81 ATL-BRU-ATL. Spent a lot of money to fly in Business Elite. Seats comfortable (lay flat) and entertainment system has an amazing selection of options. Food however was so salty and so processed that it was pretty much inedible. Crews on both flights were quite senior and offered good levels of service being most accommodating. However they all lacked a sense of warmth and welcoming. I am a big fan of Delta Air Lines but these flights were somewhat disappointing primarily due to the poor quality of food and beverage provided in both directions.
2640,10,2,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Everything was fine however My fiancÃ© and I booked together and were seated separately and they wouldn't do anything to try to get us to be close this is something that many people had complaints and passengers would switch seats to be with their loved ones. They also made us check a bag. Very unhappy about having to check that bag (which was smaller than the other bags that made it on and persons that got on after us also didn't have to check their bags). I don't recommend traveling with them. I just wish that they would have sat us next to each other it makes no sense that they didn't.
2641,5,2,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"It's been about a month now since my trip from Milan Italy to Las Vegas NV. I flew from Milan to JFK (New York). We waited 4 hours for our connecting flight from New York to Las Vegas. I was assigned a boarding pass and a seat number (24C & 24D) at Terminal 4 gate B25. When I arrived to board the plane at the gate the rudest workers at Delta claimed they didn't see me on the system. When I ask how could this be the Delta representative kept saying ""I don't know"" very condescendingly. An hour before they announced that they needed 2 volunteers to stay overnight for a next flight because they overbooked. Delta forced us to stay at JFK while letting 2 other people take our seats on the flight that we booked over a month prior. We flew all the way from Milan to JFK how were they unable to see us on the system? How were we able to get the boarding passes in the first place if we weren't in the system? The people at the service desk kept giving us attitude and saying to us that they don't see our names on the system. I was so disappointed with my flight experience."
2642,3,2,December,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I booked our Delta flight in May 2013 for 5 family members going to Jamaica Saturday Nov. 23 and returning Saturday Nov.30. We had three changes to our itinerary the last one was in Oct. The flight from Atlanta to Montego Bay was awful. We set in the very back 2 rows of the plane not together but in 2 different rows. We had no windows. On the way back it was the same way. We had our 6 year old granddaughter with us that could see nothing on her first time flying. I'm a Gold SkyMiles Member.
2643,10,29,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,SFO-ATL-LIM return in regular economy. I got a great deal from SFO to LIM. My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process. Would recommend especially if one can get a good deal.
2644,10,29,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,I traveled from Charlotte NC to Milwaukee WI and my connection in Detroit was a bit late and there was not time to transfer my suitcases. They did not arrive in baggage claim. But they delivered them 2 hours away in Madison WI on the same day and it was Thanksgiving Day.
2645,4,29,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Ireland,Not Specified,Flew to New York from Dublin with 2 small kids Fri 22 Nov and returned Mon 25. I must say I was very impressed. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The plane was full and they were kept busy but they really made my daughters feel special giving them extra cookies drinks passing chat etc. Even when one woman decided to go to the restroom a few seconds before takeoff - a potentially serious situation - they were firm but polite as they leaped down the aisle to make her sit down. IFE worked on all seats and while a couple of inches of extra legroom wouldn't have gone amiss it was fine for a six hour flight. A word about the meals. I've noticed many times that the catering supplied by European companies (ie going out) is far superior to what you get coming back from the USA regardless of airline. But that's the only criticism really. Well done Delta. In my experience you're at least as good as BA KLM and Virgin.
2646,1,28,November,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,We flew from Manchester UK to Tampa and as Delta gold members we were upgraded to business and first class due to coach being full. It was a great flight great crew and food 3 days later flew from Tampa to Texas Hobby via ATL in coach. The flights were again great snacks and drinks really good service. I feel if you are nice with their staff they are nice back.
2647,3,27,November,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"I booked a first class ticket using miles about a month ago. The only reason I booked the particular flight (red eye) was because of the 1st class seat options. At that time there were a considerable number of 1st class seats open. I checked in via mobile 24 hours before-no issues. Got through security-still no issues. When I went to board the plane I was told when they scanned my boarding pass that I'd been downgraded to Economy (not even Economy Comfort) because I was on a complimentary upgrade. I explained that absolutely was not the case and that I'd specifically booked the flight as a 1st class ticket. The response I received at that point was that ""Corporate did it because of an equipment change we don't know the criteria they used and we can't change it."" I took it up to the most senior person I could at the gate and got the same generic answer. I used to be a huge proponent of Delta and have defended them countless times to friends. I will never fly with them again."
2648,0,20,November,2013,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Netherlands,Not Specified,Good on time performance. Wished to have a second warm meal on board an intercontinental flight then just a breakfast. Very noisy cabin due insulation on the 737. Crew seemed unorganized and hasty. IFE wasn't working properly.
2649,10,20,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Early November BE flight JFK-CDG. Clean aircraft competent FA adequate catering but the Delta lounge at T4 is a disgrace. The complimentary wines are not listed anywhere while the charged offerings are both printed and on electronic pads. Salty snacks only or purchase food. Have they visited their partner Virgin Atlantic's BC lounge? On time arrival and good baggage delivery. Very limited movies on this flight.
2650,3,20,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,On time departure despite chaotic boarding in BE due to a seat configuration change. FA were quite senior and not well groomed especially the purser whose uniform was stained. The FA's were very active with service however. Catering good especially the pre arrival hamburger. Lots of videos although every time there was an announcement (and they seem to make many) my movie reverted to the French language. (CDG-EWR). Pre departure lounge was Air France which was offering a buffet lunch along with many wines champagne and snacks.
2651,8,20,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Sri Lanka,Not Specified,My wife and I flew back to London Heathrow on flight 19 from Detroit. This airline is a disgrace. Very poor food but it was the service from the flight attendants which was particularly bad. They seem to have absolutely no idea of offering a service. Passengers were treated with complete indifference and staff spent most of their time in the galley eating and talking loudly. Never again. Next time I go to Detroit I will fly BA or virgin to NY so that I only need to suffer the short hop from NYC to Detroit. Coincidentally I have a friend who has just taken a flight on Delta from NY to London who also experienced shocking service.
2652,5,20,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have been flying and traveling internationally for over 10 years and after flying Delta for the first time I will not be traveling for a very long time. Aside from the cramped plane I was refused food service on my 13 hour flight by the extremely rude flight attendants until I gave in and purchased food items. The flight itself was the absolute worst 6.5 hours of turbulence triggered my anxiety and when I tried to get my medicine from overhead I was shouted at by the attendants. Deltas entertainment was terrible and needs to be updated there were 2 small TVs in front of easily over 50 people. When the flight was over there was a half hour delay and I had to catch my next connecting flight. I will never fly Delta again.
2653,0,15,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My 7 month pregnant wife and I flew from Chicago to Mexico on Nov 7 2013 on Delta flight 8048. According to the Delta representative I spoke with on the phone Delta messed up and rescheduled everyone on this flight to Nov 8 (without telling anyone and even though the Nov 7 flight still flew). When we didn't show up for our Nov 8 flight in Chicago (since we were already in Mexico since Nov 7 and never knew about the Nov 8 flight) our return flight on Nov 10 was cancelled. We arrived to our airport in Mexico on Nov 10 to find out we had no return ticket to Chicago. The Delta representative was so sorry that she gave us a single 25 dollar gift card to split amongst the 2 of us. This is ridiculous. Why should I ever fly Delta ever again?
2654,8,15,November,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I flew from Chicago to Atlanta. The plane was full the staff very nice and friendly. My only complaint: the cabin was filthy it needed attention and the seats were small I'm a big guy 6 ft and 220 lbs. The flight was a short one if it had been longer it would have been uncomfortable.
2655,8,13,November,2013,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Worst airline to fly on if you are in the military traveling on orders. First who in the military travels with one bag that's right we don't we normaly have a few bags and one normaly weighs between 50 to 100 lbs. So why is it that all the other carriers let the military check one bag up to 100lbs no we are not getting over this is the bag that we transport our gear in. The gear that we use to take the fight to the enemy. Come on Delta get with the program and stop trying to make an extra buck off the military. I guess that's why the military generally uses American Airlines first and Delta only as a last resort. The flight only had a few people on board and when some of them asked if they could move to a vacant seat they were told no.
2656,0,13,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Manchester - Atlanta - San Diego. Plenty of snacks and drinks served. Lunch was good and enjoyable. Good selection of films television and music staff were pleasant and efficient. Temperature of cabin was just right. A very positive experience.
2657,8,10,November,2013,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Singapore,Not Specified,BusinessElite SIN-NRT-HNL. Choose Delta only because it offered completely flat beds. B777-200LR flying from SIN-NRT- SIN offers ample legroom when in full recline. However the 767-300 planes NRT-HNL-NRT falls short for anyone over 6â€™. In full bed mode the â€˜seatâ€™ tucks into the narrow space of the seat in front of you. My main gripe was the cleanliness of the cabin. Dirtiest Business Class I've ever flown! Cabin Staff were ok not overly friendly. Pales to any Asian flight crew.
2658,10,10,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"My Husband and I booked First Class. Our plane was finally determined as ""Delayed for Catering"" for 4 hours. We missed our connection of course. Originally we were told it was due to weather. There were no other flights to get us home according to the agent in Salt Lake City who said ""I don't have time to help you go over there to the phone bank"". With no flight no luggage and no help we paid for a hotel room had to by clothes meals and I hoped our underwear would dry I washed it in the sink for the next days flight. We had purposely reserved seats together I have a great deal of flight anxiety. Our rescheduled flights separated us and I cried most of the way home. It's not that we are any better than others but we paid a lot of money for our trip on Delta First Class. We bought the special tickets expecting special service. I'm disturbed with the airlines performance and regard for passengers. I guess we paid for only a larger seat."
2659,1,10,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,SEA-AMS-SEA. This last transatlantic with Delta will be my very last. I cannot believe KLM/Air France have partnered with Delta and I'm afraid I'm unlikely to continue patronising that group unless I'm sure I'm not flying on a Delta staffed plane. The service was just appalling. The seats in economy were very poor. The underseat space was cramped by some electrical equipment and also very hot as a result. The in-flight entertainment system was not functioning in my seat or any other seat in our row. The only element of the flight that was any good was the lounge in Seattle which had some space to work and attentive staff.
2660,7,6,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,When my wife and I travel we usually travel with Delta or Alaska. We always travel first class and so cannot comment on how things are in coach however we have never been disappointed with Delta traveling first class. They always treat us well from check-in to in-flight. The planes are always clean and the staff is incredibly attentive. Unlike Alaska they never skimp on the amenities. They serve full size meals and are constantly checking to see if there is anything else they can do to accommodate you.
2661,8,4,November,2013,First Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,I have to say that whilst everyone likes to moan about airlines my recent flight with Delta was great on their services from/to LHR-JFK. The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding. For the price it was truly excellent.
2662,8,4,November,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Just flew from BWI to Melbourne FL. Worst flights I have ever had. Both flights were overbooked. The staff were asking for volunteers to take a later flight. The staff were confused and had no idea on what they were doing. They were rude and didn't know their jobs very well. This was both trips with connecting flights in Atlanta both ways. Never will I fly Delta again. One of the staff was standing at the desk telling customers she was nobody and couldn't help anyone. Now that is customer service from Delta Airlines.
2663,8,31,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My husband and I took a vacation back to the Midwest. We flew Delta from LAX to Minneapolis to Milwaukee with the reverse for the return flights. I was really dreading this - I have MS and knew I would be using a wheelchair. Everything was great! Flights were on time and the pilot and crew were so kind friendly and helpful. My husband and I are tall and we were pleasantly surprised to have ample leg room. Also Delta did a great job with the video on pre-flight safety notes. No one seems to listen to the actual stewards and stewardesses when it comes to this but the video had everyone's attention in this digital age. I definitely recommend flying Delta.
2664,9,29,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,SFO to SLC and SLC to LAX in First. Old Airbus 320 on first leg. Interesting no life vests on board just the 'buoyant' seat cushion. Newish 737-800 on leg to LAX. Excellent service and attention from Hawaiian based crew best of any American airline I have traveled on. Both flights on time check in very quick and luggage appeared rapidly. Would recommend.
2665,8,28,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,France,Not Specified,I flew from Toronto to Atlanta Atlanta to Cancun and Cancun to Atlanta. The seats were very comfy with a good recline especially between Atlanta and Cancun. Crew was very polite but the food choice was very poor. My flight between Toronto and Atlanta was the worst. It was operated by express jet on the behalf of Delta Airlines: poor food was served and the crew wasn't helpful at all. The seats were very hard. Definitely a bad flight. I recommend to fly with Delta airlines despite all but avoid to fly with it subsidiary express jet.
2666,7,28,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,France,Not Specified,SFO-LAX LAX-KOA KOA-LAX LAX-SEA SEA-CDG. Very nice experience (again) with Delta. I love Delta upgrade policies on internal flights everything is clear and fair you know at any time why you have been upgraded or not. All flights on time cabin crew smiling all the time and very professional. Very nice food. Twice upgraded with my ElitePlus status. Delta Economy comfort seats really worth.
2667,6,22,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Canada,Not Specified,"On our outbound flight the crew ensured some people with ""carry on"" luggage checked their luggage prior to boarding. It appears that many of these ""carry on"" suitcases would not fit into the guide at the check in counter. Often these suitcases barely fit into the overhead. We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find. For this trip it was Delta (Alaska). But just because I may find a good price does not mean that I should be treated this way."

2669,0,20,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"In my opinion Delta airline is the worst I have experienced. I am silver and this is the end of my Delta loyalty. I attempted to hop on an earlier flight several times because I had completed my work in Greensboro early. The lady eagerly said "" are you Gold or Platinum""? I said ""no I am Silver."" She stated it would be 50 dollars to go on standby but she is not going to bother because I am silver. With that I was dismissed with a ""Next"". This is not the first time this has occurred and I travel for business. For validity sake my flight number originally prior to attempting an earlier flight was DL1384 from GSO to ATL."

First time experiencing flying with Delta and it was very disappointing. Like previous comments booked ticket through KLM/Air France where we have always receive a brilliant service. Wondering why they have partnered with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever so rude cabin crew. Nobody at the entrance to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not a single smile and very abrupt cabin crew members. The only good thing was they had a good selection of entertainment at least it kept our mind away from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a domestic flight compared to the opposite for the international flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not a single smile from the ground crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. International flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this time at the entrance and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was waiting for me as soon as I popped down the seat tray in front of me to read. Yes it was messy with food stain and dry sauce on it from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done pretty much straight away but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew. What was more intriguing was the contrast of service between the domestic and the international flights. Will not recommend it to any friends or family.
2671,10,20,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flight DL241 from Rome to Atlanta. Great flight and service from stewards. We even couldn't fill the 11 hour flight. Great attitude and always busy.
2672,9,20,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Poor customer service. Sold my seat to someone who was on standby in a complete and utter shambles mix up. Had to ask people to leave the plane for compensation. Poor attitude of staff not helpful at all no empathy for customers situations. Poor service on flights entertainment not working and having to reboot seems to be a daily problem. Planes were dirty and tired. Food was average breakfast dire scrambled egg in a soggy roll after an 8 hour flight. Why not keep it simple with a croissant or pastry or muffin? Wouldn't fly again if I had the choice.
2673,10,16,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,"My disabled husband few up to PA from Dallas. His flight up was delayed in Atlanta because the plane he was supposed to fly out on lost its navigation system and they had to find another. That was bad enough but on his way home he left Harrisburg and flew into Detroit when he got off the plane he asked for a wheelchair and help getting to the gate where his connecting flight was departing and was told ""Just go that way and turn left and you will get to the gate."" He got no help so missed his flight to DFW because he was not able to hurry. He was re- ticketed and had to fly into Atlanta before he could return to Texas. On the flight from Atlanta to DFW he was assigned a seat in the back. I was told it was my fault that my husband couldn't get a wheelchair because I didn't book his flight as a disabled passenger! Like I said before this is not the first time we have had issues with Delta but it will be the last!"
2674,0,15,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,JFK to LHR leaving 9.10pm 12th Oct. Delta 0005. Have just returned from NY to London and can only agree with the negative reviews. The most rude cabin staff I have ever experienced. We actually got our tickets through Air France and I noticed that another partner was Virgin an airline I use frequently to go to Tokyo with and rate highly. What on Earth are these decent airlines partnering with this outfit for? Food was also terrible and complimentary drink service a joke. The public address system didn't work I see others have commented the same why can't they fix simple things like that? They must know it doesn't work the staff get angry when you ask them to repeat things. A bad end to an otherwise superb visit to the Big Apple.
2675,8,13,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Flew Delta Connection (ExpressJet) from Gainesville Florida to Atlanta. Flight was on time and actually arrived ahead of schedule. ExpressJet (DBA Delta Connection) much better than when ASA flew this route as Delta Connection.
2676,1,13,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Took 4 Delta flights over the summer Amsterdam-Boston Boston-Atlanta Atlanta-Chicago and Boston-Amsterdam on each of the flights the cabin crew were very friendly and attentive (especially the Atlanta-Chicago flight) were relaxed and seemed to enjoy their job. Seats on all flights were very comfortable and the inflight entertainment on the two international segments was very comprehensive. Plenty of legroom too. Full meal service and hot towels were provided on the international segments which was much appreciated. Domestically Free drinks and snacks were offered which is really all that was required for these flights. I will recommend Delta to my friends and family and look forward to flying with them again along with their partner KLM they offer an excellent route network.
2677,0,10,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I booked a flight from Denver Colorado to Rochester NY with a connecting flight in LaGuardia. I booked the flight for my grandfathers funeral that was the next morning. The flight was delayed so I was unable to make my connecting flight. Instead they put me on a flight to Salt Lake City Utah to go to Atlanta Georgia to go to Rochester NY. It took over 20 hours to get from Denver to Rochester there was no compassion for my situation by the Delta airline staff. Horrible customer service. I will never fly Delta again.
2678,5,10,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Australia,Not Specified,with a group of 86 flying DL16 and 17 SYD-LAX return Sept/Oct 2013. this is the second large group experience on this route with Delta the last being four years ago. As in the last I have nothing but praise for Delta. Check- ins with lots of excess/oversized luggage were most efficient and very quick indeed. The ground staff at both terminals were polite well trained and accommodating. The self check-in computers in LAX were very intuitive and easy to use. Both flights were on time. Inflight service was excellent. Flying the return route in the back of economy I noted how little wait there was for meals after the service had started. Again the service was not only quick but accommodating and compared very well to Singapore; my personal benchmark. The food was fine for economy class airline fare. The entertainment options were comprehensive. Perhaps the airline could upgrade its earphones a little. Seating was comfortable. The Comfort Economy which I used on the outward bound trip was well and truly worth the money. Most importantly Delta has its own terminal at LAX; meaning you avoid the general admissions hall. This is an excellent reason in itself to choose the airline on the SYD-LAX route.
2679,8,9,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,South Africa,Not Specified,"I regularly travel between South Africa and the USA always on South African Airways (SAA). I have just travelled on Delta from South Africa to Atlanta. Both the ground staff and cabin staff were appalling. Gives rudeness a whole new meaning. Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off. SAA offers seats in the emergency exit at no charge. Delta uses this as another opportunity to rip off customers. Delta staff do yourselves a favour and travel on SAA to find out how to offer a high lass service."
2680,0,9,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,China,Not Specified,29th Sep from Shanghai to Tokyo on DL296 and from Tokyo to Shanghai by DL295 on 5th Oct. I took the flight to and fro from Shanghai to Tokyo. it was a nice experience. The safety presentation that they provide is really unique. Food Quality was also excellent. Staff was very polite inside the airline but Staff at Tokyo Airport Check-In counters were rude and unfriendly and I hope Delta can do something about it as it spoils the image of the airline. The flights were on time and my kids really enjoyed the in-flight entertainment.
2681,6,7,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again.
2682,1,7,October,2013,Premium Economy,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,October 6 from LAX to ATL-Flight started out fine nothing really to complain about. The stewards were average somewhat snooty. Had a good selection of entertainment. Regular snacks on the plain (peanuts pretzels cookies). The end of the flight was extremely rough due to rain but the captain gave some reassurance. Then we landed with only minutes until our next connecting flight to MGM. This is where our trip took a nasty turn. We arrived at the gate with 20 minutes to spare (our flight was to take off at 8.55) but our flight was delayed 5 minutes so we had some breathing room. Then our flight got delayed another 20 minutes then another hour then at 11.45 (sitting in the terminal for over two hours) they cancelled it. We got a rental car that we could have had two hours ago and been home by now.
2683,10,6,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,6 sectors with Delta in last 3 month. Winnipeg-Minneapolis-Amsterdam on July 10th Amsterdam-Minneapolis-Winnipeg on August 19th then Winnipeg-MSP-LaGuardia on August 27th. All flights except one on time great service provided by cabin crew. On long haul flights hot towels were offered which is very nice touch. Great food and beverages. Bags delivered promptly on arrival. Delta prices and customer service is definitely competitive. Will fly with them again!
2684,3,2,October,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,Man to SFO via Atlanta. New York to Manchester via Atlanta. Both Manchester flights on A330 very comfortable seating is 2x4x2 with each seat having its own inflight entertainment. Other sectors on A319/b737. Service on all the flights was excellent very friendly staff. A lot better than American. Reserved seats together on all flights when booking saved a lot of problems at check in. Transfer in Atlanta was quick and efficient well within 90 minutes suggested. Flights were a good deal.
2685,3,29,September,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,AUS to JFK JFK to NCE flight DL 1972 and DL 0082. Return NCE to AMS to ATL to AUS. DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1. In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.
2686,3,29,September,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United Kingdom,Not Specified,LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR (via Detroit). I purchased the tickets for almost Â£300 cheaper then the British Airways / Virgin Atlantic equivalent - and it was money well saved! To JFK had great pitch in 767 economy great food drink and snacks and the on demand touch screen entertainment meant the flight went really quick. All the internal flights were on 757s and they were as equally as good and all had touch screen on demand entertainment which I wasn't expecting. It's right to say that American airlines have a bad reputation but my perception has changed and when I come back to the USA next year I will fly delta. The product is on par if not better then the other airlines and would recommend them.
2687,10,29,September,2013,Business Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,I have been a gold member for at least one year. I usually fly every 4 to 6 weeks from DCA to Lagos Nigeria. The food service is extremely poor. Breakfast is disappointing I have now learnt to eat before flying. The airline assumes everyone can eat the cheesy bread served in the AM the rice has practically no taste and the bathrooms are in such a bad state before we land. I have only been upgraded twice on the economy flights. I ask each time and the response is the same 'you may or may not be upgraded and you will be told at the gate'. I flew Air France on the trip before last and even got upgraded on that flight to economy comfort. Delta really does need to appreciate their gold members. I fly delta because of convenience but I'm beginning to think it may not be worth it. Bad food with no absolutely no fringe benefits is quite frustrating especially when other airlines offer much more. To fly long distance every 4 to 6 weeks with no benefits are not worth it.
2688,9,26,September,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,United States,Not Specified,Whatever happened to schedule integrity? We booked our vacation to St. Martin on Delta because no overnight flights were required. Then they changed their schedule and now we have to overnight in Detroit on the way home. They will do nothing about this inconvenience and expense.
2689,0,25,September,2013,Economy Class,Not Specified,Not Specified,Direct Flight,Not Specified,Italy,Not Specified,Seattle (SeaTac) - Paris (CDG): 23 September. Flight was horrible! Low Seat comfort and low quality food. But the worst thing is seat assignment: my girlfriend was behind me and that's how it was for a lot of couples and friends! It's obvious that this is done on purpose in order to earn money from change seat utility during the check-in online.
